This is to prevent someone from seeing the password transmitted over the air with plain text.If you can, stay away from ECB (use CBC) mode of the encryption algorithm you pick, as it might give some info on the data transmitted. More info on that can be found here.On the bluetooth data transmission, make sure to include some unique ID, so that the message can't be repeated (for example, you might include a timestamp). You might also implement some TOTP-like system.Put a port on the device that allows it to be easily flashed, so that in case you realize the software has a bug (and for some reason you can't update it OTA), the device is not an expensive paperweight, just a device that needs to be plugged into a PC and flashed to new software.Extra: To ensure that someone with a rogue root cert (probably self-issued and installed on client device) can't intercept your server communications, verify the HTTPS certificate.

150,9,0,NA,17,"The absolute most common issue with IoT devices is default passwords. So change all the passwords. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 random (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.If the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.The second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device. Connections should always go through a gateway that itself requires authentication to cross, and that you keep patched with any security updates.You should also apply security updates on all the devices… if they exist at all, which can be a problem.",227,0,0,0
151,19,0,NA,11,"If you can have end-to-end TCP, then use end-to-end TLS (e.g. with HTTPS).Don't reinvent the wheel, especially when it comes to cryptography — most people get it wrong. Unless the device is too resource-constrained to support TLS, if you get down to the level of AES, you're doing it wrong. #1 mistake is to encrypt and forget to authenticate — if you have an encrypted channel between your server and a man-in-the-middle, instead of an encrypted channel between your server and your device, then encryption hasn't provided any benefit. If you can't use TLS, make sure that whatever protocol you're using authenticates everything, and encrypts what needs to be confidential.To use TLS securely, think about what guarantees you need to have, from the point of view of each participant. Generally the device needs to know that it's talking to the legitimate server. That means that it must check the server's certificate. The device must have the X.509 certificate of a certificate authority recorded as trusted; this requires storage that can't be modified by an attacker, but it doesn't require any confidentiality of the storage. Note that you shouldn't hard-code the server's certificate directly, because that wouldn't let you easily replace that certificate if it's compromised. Instead, the device stores the expected identity (host name) of the server, and the certificate of a certificate authority that guarantees that a certain public key belongs to the expected host name. Once again, don't reinvent the wheel, rely on the certificate checking provided by your TLS library or application.If the server needs to know that it's talking to a legitimate client, then each client needs to have its own client certificate. That requires confidential storage on the client. Pass the client certificate to the TLS session opening function from your TLS library, or set it in the application configuration.That takes care of securing the communication between your server and your device. If the mobile application can talk to the device directly (e.g. to allow disconnected operation while it's on the local wifi network), you need to first perform pairing between the smart switch and the mobile phone. Pairing means an exchange of keys, preferably an exchange of public keys if resources permit, otherwise an agreement of secret keys. The goal of this pairing is to ensure that each device knows who it's talking to.You'll need to secure the control channel as well, whether it goes directly from the mobile device to the smart switch or via a server. Think about authorization: are there different levels of access to the switch, e.g. a control level that allows doing reconfiguration and a basic channel that just allows on/off switching? This is generally handled by an authentication step after establishing the secure channel (TLS if possible).Another consideration is firmware updates. That's a tricky one: on the one hand, there's no such thing as absolute security, so you will have security patches to apply now and then. On the other hand, a firmware upgrade mechanism is a complex thing and might itself have bugs. At the very least, make sure that your firmware upgrades are signed. Relying purely on the security of the communication channel for upgrades is dodgy, because the trusted based for a secure channel is larger than for a static security verification, and sometimes you might want to apply firmware updates without a network connection. In addition to verifying the signature, ideally you should have some protection against rollback, so that an adversary can't just push an “update” to version 1 on a system running version 2 and then exploit the security hole that version 2 patched.",600,0,0,0
152,143,1,22399,11,"Generally speaking, an agent is a 'bi-directional' piece of software; i.e., it reads parameters from the device and the communicates the same to cloud or even a gateway. More often than not, an OEM will control the libraries for development of the software to control the parameters of the device. Whereas, the OEM may choose any of the popular communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, etc.) to publish the values read. Typically, integration of these two is the space where a System Integrator comes in.For example, an agent could be running on a Windows desktop to read the rpm of the fan every 5 seconds. This value is then communicated over to a cloud platform over an agreed protocol.Sample code from Paho MQTT (Python) web site:The above snippet is roughly an agent because there is the 'from device' part in the form of the function sensor.blocking_read() and the 'to cloud' part in the form of a mqttc.publish().Advanced agents will have mechanisms to handle offline storage, TLS support for communication towards cloud, respond to any updates from cloud (including reboots, if needed) gracefully, etc. And, in the specific case of this question, the agent will handle power constraints too.

WiFi Direct has a range of around 600 ft, which can be vary on the real world scenarios, but seemingly, wifi can transfer data to longer distances.Security:WiFi Direct is using WPA2 with AES 256-bit encryption, while bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption.

Here are some more general thoughts/philosophies.A DMZ is your friend - In almost every case where you have a service facing an external network a DMZ (see a.) will be very beneficial. In this case it will both minimize the attack surface and minimize the damage. By limiting the number of devices in the DMZ to only the ones that need external access you limit the attack surface. Also the DMZ will make it much harder for anyone to access your core network, thus minimizing the damage.Whitelist, don't Blacklist - By default every single protocol, port and internal connection should be blocked by default. This blocking should be setup in the device (if possible), the firewall and the router. Only enable options that you are actively using and only for the devices that need one. If you know and must use a protocol for an IoT device that is weak (for example devices that are affected by Mirai) you should setup a device (like a RaspberryPi) to act as relay.

I've made a bunch of internet controlled sockets using ESP8266 ESP-01S modules (not the ESP-01, which has less memory) and cheap Chinese relay boards. You need one relay per controlled device, but can add dozens of relays to each ESP-01S if you make use of something like the MCP23017 I2S port expander. As you're dealing with mains voltage you also need to factor in the costs of sensible enclosures. The ESP-01S serves up a basic web interface with on/off buttons that toggle the relays, which serve power up to your devices.

214,1,0,NA,10,"There are two main approaches to characterising an antenna and its effectiveness in-system, free space and in-situ. The first will give you a best-case baseline, is less susceptible to measurement noise (especially if you have access to a large anechoic chamber), and probably works best for selecting between candidate antenna variations. In-situ measurements are much less definitive, but allow you to be specific about a possible working scenario, and rule out silly mistakes (like forgetting that the final device has a conductive casework).Both approaches require a transmit-receive pair. Either one or both can be real devices, propagation is commutative. Take care to use representative power supplies and autonomous operation on real test device. If you connect power or serial cables, these become part of the antenna system.A good alternative to a spectrum analyser is a Software Defined Radio. Certain USB-DVBTV dongles can be used at very low cost. You shouldn't be as concerned about signal fidelity in this scenario, simple signal strength should be enough. Ideally you will be close enough in that uncorrected error rate is not a useful metric. Independently, you should understand how signal strength, uncorrected error rate and system performance are related to work out what operating point you are aiming for.For free space measurements, ideally you will be in an open field, free of power lines and reflective structures for many 10s of metres. Place the DUT on a wooden stand, and observe it from a distance of 5-10 metres (several wavelengths at least). Rotate it in all directions, and measure. Repeat with a comparative device, repeat with any other variations you care about. A directional antenna at the frequency of interest is normally used at one end of the test range, this removes some variation due to the test location (and your presence near this end)For in-situ measurements, it is important to trial as many realistic deployments as you can. Ideally you would run device-to-device, with signal quality being logged on the device. Look for the worst-case scenarios that you can find - end users are likely to find even worse ones.If in doubt, consult an EMC test facility.

These two features can be looked for. The first needs a very sophisticated network traffic monitoring solution and intricate knowledge about what kind of traffic you expect in your network. If your IoT device does not communicate via a WiFi connection but over 3G or other mobile telecommunication standards you are pretty much out of luck because you cannot monitor those.

Infected systems can be cleaned by rebooting them, but since scanning for these devices happens at a constant rate, it’s possible for them to be reinfected within minutes of a reboot.

221,-1,NA,4952,8,"I've been reading about XMPP as a potential communications protocol for IoT devices but, after reading one source, I'm unsure whether it's really an appropriate protocol if you're concerned about overhead for each message.This source states: However, XMPP has a number of problems that make it somewhat undesirable for EMBEDDED IOT PROTOCOLS. As an XML-based protocol, XMPP is very verbose, even more so than HTTP, and has heavy data overhead. A single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB.  There is a draft specification that would compress XMPP using an XML encoding called efficient XML Interchange (EXI). But even with EXI, the same one byte of data gets hundreds of bytes of protocol overhead from XMPP alone. EXI is also a much harder format to process than other options now available. Because of these inherent problems, it is generally recommended to avoid using XMPP in embedded IoT applications.However, XMPP promotes itself as suitable for IoT applications (although it doesn't specifically say that it's low-overhead), so it seems odd that such a large, seemingly verbose protocol would be recommended/promoted for IoT devices.Is the overhead of XMPP really as large as the source suggests for small amounts of data? For example, how much overhead would there be when sending an 8-byte message? Also, is the overhead so great if EXI compression is used (as mentioned in the source)? Would this also come with some pitfalls?",247,0,1,0

224,221,1,4952,5,"While it's fair to say that XML is verbose, that should be tempered with the awareness that this verbosity is not all ""overhead"" in relation to content since it encapsulates semantics; it's overhead that's symptomatic of any protocol that emphasises a dynamic as opposed to static structure. For example, HTML is really a relaxed form of XML that conveys content with a dynamic structure, structure that could be considered an aspect of the content. You can distinguish the content of a table from the table itself, but the fact that the content is tabular data with specific relations is integral to the content; if I just took each cell and transmitted it all as one long string, that structure and those relationships are gone, and so I have lost information and isn't that content?Let's consider an 8 byte message that might constitute some tabluar data. If I use a very static protocol, I could, minimally, transmit that with no additional overhead simply by defining a protocol like this:Each message is exactly 8 bytes, so we don't need to indicate the length or include any terminating sequence.The eight bytes are always taken to refer to a 2 x 2 grid where each cell contains a 16-bit value.If all my messages are exactly like that, using XML, HTML or XMPP might be considered silly — I am wasting bandwidth on structural components that are always the same and predetermined anyway, and wasting corresponding computation time at both ends creating and parsing it. A minimal, proper HTML page that contains just a 2 x 2 table with a couple of characters in each cell is probably going to be at least 100 bytes to accommodate the formatting and protocol overhead.However, if not all my messages are exactly that, then specifying what kind of message it is may not be a literal part of the ""payload"" but it is a necessary component, content-wise. I could do that with just an extra two bytes and introduce much more dynamism:Messages are now variable length, 0-255 bytes, and the first byte indicates the length.There are (up to) 256 codes for different predefined message types, one of which is ""2 x 2 table"", that's the second byte.Now my 8 bytes of table content require 2 bytes of overhead, but there is a much wider range of possibilities in terms of what kinds of messages can be sent with this custom protocol.It's still nowhere close to the possibilities of an HTML page or XML namespace specification (or set thereof, which is what XMPP essentially is).So, based on that, if mostly what you are doing is sending simple 8 byte messages, XMPP is probably overkill. However, not necessarily that much. The claim that ""a single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB"" seems to me, glancing at the relevant RFC, to be a potential exaggeration (but n.b., all I did is glance at it, I've never implemented or used XMPP). I don't doubt you could construct an example of such, but that is probably not a minimal example.Since the protocol is TCP oriented, establishing ""an XML stream qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace"" only needs to be considered part of the message if we are doing one off things — device contacts a server to send 8 bytes to, sends the data, disconnects. If the relationship is more persistent, which it would often be in an IoT context, then we can assume the device already has an established connection to the destination. In this case, if the ultimate destination of the message is the server (as opposed to another client the server is going to pass the message on to), then the protocol overhead is potentially minimal.A measly 33 bytes of ""overhead"". It is worth pointing out here that XML is text, and so if your messages are often binary, then it is going to become much less appropriate, because that data needs to be encoded (e.g., to base64), which adds further overhead and computational requirements.So, ultimately: Does XMPP have a large overhead for IoT devices sending short, frequent messages?If there is a persistent connection and the messages are largely unstructured, I don't think so. However, if you don't need what it offers (the dynamism with regard to structure), then there are probably more appropriate methodologies. Pursuit to that, if we have a context where a single central server is processing and/or relying messages between a variety of devices, even though what any one of those devices is doing may always be simple and straightforward, a protocol which can encapsulate a variety of messages would still be useful. If a client device has limited resources, we can hardcode much of the protocol, and wrapping each message from that end becomes a very simple task; I believe many IoT devices which deploy HTTP servers do that (which is the inverse of ""simple clients, complex server""). Those servers cannot handle any kind of HTTP request (except via preformatted rejection) and have a very well defined, focused set of things thing will do and responses they will send, but since they none-the-less function correctly as HTTP servers, implementing clients across a very broad range of commonplace devices (including smartphones and PCs) is simple.",882,1,0,0

229,228,0,NA,8,"The simple answer is yes - you need enough blocks of flash to support bootloader and A/B code images if you want high reliability. Before activating the new image, you can write the whole thing, verify it and potentially retry.However this is an expensive/reliable strategy and there are things you can do to reduce the overhead. Low level support for OTA updates may also come as part of the device firmware or OS, so you can avoid rolling-your-own unless you want to learn. This feature might be described as FOTA.Partitioning your code base allows for incremental updates, best case the bootloader is able to bring up the network connection, download and verify code without needing any fall-back user code. With a local gateway, management of this task can be delegated from the low-cost endpoints.Many devices have a small amount of word-erase flash, and even failing this you can usually set bits without needing to erase a whole block. These features can be used to manipulate jump tables and stitch together code which is updated in block sizes chunks. Even if you initially planned for a full A/B code space, you might need to fall back to a more complex scheme when the codebase grows too much.To clarify the functionality which can be achieved with a sophisticated firmware-over-the-air solution, the bootloader and potentially a primary communication stack can remain resident whilst the full remaining user application space is re-flashed. This doesn't need any overhead (particularly if the block partitioning is soft). In the scenario where the communication stack needs to be upgraded, the region generally used for application code can be temporarily used during download and verification.

Systems using flash memory swap  In devices with two or more internal flash blocks that support swap, the memory base address of each flash block can be exchanged. The address location of each flash block will thus be swapped in the logical memory map of the device. After a reset, the built-in flash swap system essentially selects which software executes by the location of the flash block in the logical memory map. This allows a code back-up system with the added ease of programming. You can execute out of one block while erasing/programming the other block. On Kinetis devices, the flash swap system monitors/controls all the steps of switching from the old application to new; there is an added assurance of reliable operation in the case of a power loss during one of those steps.  Advantages    Ease of programming. Application always executes out of the lower block in the memory map. Power loss tolerant. No bootloader required. No delay to the start of the main application. Well suited for a multi-tasking OS. Minimal application downtime. In a multi-tasking system it is possible to continue to execute the main application tasks while background tasks are running to update the new copy of the application. Backup copy of code.

232,230,1,13751,6,"In ""The Simon and Speck Block Ciphers on AVR 8-bit Microcontrollers"" Beaulieu et al. investigate the implementation of SIMON and SPECK on a low-end 8-bit microcontroller and compare the performance to other cyphers. An Atmel ATmega128 is used with 128 Kbytes of programmable flash memory, 4 Kbytes of SRAM, and thirty-two 8-bit general purpose registers.Three encryption implementations are compared: RAM-minimizing  These implementations avoid the use of RAM to store round keys by including the pre-expanded round keys in the flash program memory. No key schedule is included for updating this expanded key, making these implementations suitable for applications where the key is static.High-throughput/low-energy These implementations include the key schedule and unroll enough copies of the round function in the encryption routine to achieve a throughput within about 3% of a fully- unrolled implementation. The key, stored in flash, is used to generate the round keys which are subsequently stored in RAM.Flash-minimizing The key schedule is included here. Space limitations mean we can only provide an incomplete description of these implementations. However, it should be noted that the previous two types of implementations already have very modest code sizes.To compare different cyphers a performance efficiency measure - rank - is used. The rank is proportional to throughput divided by memory usage. SPECK ranks in the top spot for every block and key size which it supports. Except for the 128-bit block size, SIMON ranks second for all block and key sizes.   ...  Not surprisingly, AES-128 has very good performance on this platform, although for the same block and key size, SPECK has about twice the performance. For the same key size but with a 64-bit block size, SIMON and SPECK achieve two and four times better overall performance, respectively, than AES. Comparing SPECK 128/128 to AES-128 the authors find that the memory footprint of SPECK is significantly reduced (460 bytes vs. 970 bytes) while throughput is only slightly decreased (171 cycles/byte vs. 146 cycles/byte).Thus SPECK's performance (in the chosen metric) is higher than AES. Considering that speed is correlated with energy consumption the authors conclude that ""AES-128 may be a better choice in energy critical applications than SPECK 128/128 on this platform."" The authors however are uncertain whether heavy usage of RAM access (high-speed AES implementations) are more energy efficient than a register-based implementation of SPECK. In either case a significant reduction in flash memory usage can be achieved which might be of relevance on low-end microcontrollers. If an application requires high speed, and memory usage is not a priority, AES has the fastest implementation (using 1912 bytes of flash, 432 bytes RAM) among all block ciphers with a 128-bit block and key that we are aware of, with a cost of just 125 cycles/byte. The closest AES competitor is SPECK 128/128, with a cost of 138 cycles/byte for a fully unrolled implementation. Since speed is correlated with energy consumption, AES-128 may be a better choice in energy critical applications than SPECK 128/128 on this platform. However, if a 128-bit block is not required, as we might expect for many applications on an 8-bit microcontroller, then a more energy effcient solution (using 628 bytes of flash, 108 bytes RAM) is SPECK 64/128 with the same key size as AES-128 and an encryption cost of just 122 cycles/byte, or SPECK 64/96 with a cost of 118 cycles/byte.Additionally, this talk has an Enigma figure in it, who could resist a cypher that references Enigma?",574,0,1,0

Wi-Fi HaLow extends Wi-Fi into the 900 MHz band, enabling the low power connectivity necessary for applications including sensor and wearables. Wi-Fi HaLow’s range is nearly twice that of today’s Wi-Fi, and will not only be capable of transmitting signals further, but also providing a more robust connection in challenging environments where the ability to more easily penetrate walls or other barriers is an important consideration.However, as mentioned in the linked source, HaLow operates in the 900MHz frequency, which, according to eWeek, is an unlicensed frequency: Unfortunately, the new HaLow standard doesn't have its frequencies to itself. Because the 900MHz band is shared with other licensed services, the new WiFi band is subject to interference from other users and there is no remedy when that interference happens.  For example, if a ham radio operator next door goes on the air with a powerful signal that wipes out your smart thermostat, you're out of luck. Because you're an unlicensed service, you're required to accept that interference.  However, if your smart thermostat happens to cause interference to that ham radio operator next door, then you're required to stop doing it. As an unlicensed user, you have few rights to the spectrum if someone else wants to use it.Presumably this is related to the FCC rules which are commonly seen on RF products: This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.Does this make HaLow too problematic for use as a communication method, since my transmissions could easily be forced to stop if someone else was transmitting in that frequency?

283,-1,NA,NA,14,"The motivation for this question comes from the fact that some time ago I created a simple proof of concept (PoC) IoT edge device using a microcontroller and a CC3100 Wifi network processor. One of the problems with this prototype was that the configuration required a considerable amount power. Thus, it could not overcome the benefits of the existing lower power device which could last for over 2 to 10 years depending on choice of battery and usage frequency.Depending on the application, the current product uses a 6V DC battery with a capacity between 1400 mAh and 2400 mAh. The device has a low power sensing element and an actuating mechanism. The payload most likely will be around 100 bytes. The frequency of communication will be about every two minutes during peak activity. With the advances in the IoT and market demands, this PoC has gained some attention.Per the suggestion of few IOT platform providers I am looking at CC3200 wireless MCU from Texas Instrument primarily because it is the successor to the CC3100. At a system level when not in use the CC3100 power can be completely switched off. This is a significant advantage for low power at a systems level. When activity is detected the sensing element wakes up the microcontroller via an interrupt. There are other integrated wifi MCU’s such as ESP8266, BCM43362, ATWINC1500B, 88MC200 and many more. I use ULPBench Scores to do a first order analysis of low power microcontrollers followed by analysis such as described in How to select a micro controller for a low power application? to help select a low power microcontroller. I have used parameters such as active mode current draw per frequency, and current draw a different low power modes to make an informed selection. So in order to maintain the low power option and to add IoT capability, what are critical parameters (may related to wireless communication) that I should I pay close attention to when selecting an integrated wifi MCU?References:SimpleLink™ CC3100/CC3200 Wi-Fi Internet-on-a-chip Networking Sub-system Power ManagementHow to Select your Wi-Fi Module?",343,0,8,0

292,286,1,32536,9,"TL;DR: EconomicsWired mesh network vs. star topologyWell, the Internet is a mesh network. Why? Because DARPA wanted it to work even if half the United States were bombed into oblivion if the cold war was going hot. The military wanted a highly reliable network that is not dependent on any single node. Meshing or at least partial meshing your network nodes will give you that reliability. The major drawback of (wired) mesh networks is that they are not very cost efficient. They cost a lot. Cabling every component to every other component is just too expensive. So the WAN backbone of the Internet of Things is already a wired mesh network.Star topology is needs just one cable per node, while meshing uses up to n*(n-1)/2 for a full mesh. The cabling for mesh networks gets a lot more expensive very fast. Thus, star topology emerged as the dominant standard.Now (mostly) new, wireless mesh networksEstablishing wireless mesh networks circumvents the major drawback of wired mesh networks. There is no cabling cost to create a wireless mesh network. Thus, creating wireless mesh networks pairs the reliability network creators always wanted with the low cost of few cables and of course all the other advantages of being wireless.However there are still a few drawbacks of mesh networks. Nodes have to be relatively smart for the routing compared to simply connecting to one central node. ZigBee uses Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing, which requires routing tables at each node. Also a certain duplex capability of the nodes is required to make the network efficient. Bringing that on a low-cost, wireless-capable microchip took some time. Today we have those chips.For a mesh network to work properly there have to be enough nodes. It actually gets more efficient with more nodes (that connect to at least two existing ones). Thus, the Internet of Things were everything can act as a node is an obvious match for meshed networks. While other topologies would possibly clog up with more nodes mesh networks really start to shine there and get faster and more reliable the more nodes are added.Your 10-20 node networkFor a smart home setting with one or two dozen devices there are a few things to consider regarding topology. Firstly, ZigBee actually supports star topology as well. Secondly, any sort of distance vector routing usually works with weighted vector values. Thus, in a smart home setting the direct connection could very well be rated highest and you'll end up with a defact star topology even when it's configured as a mesh.Only the device that are out of range of a central component like a Hue Bridge (or rate the direct connection bad enough) will even make use of the mesh topology. For these devices mesh networking is essentially a low latency range extension for your network. Thus, you don't have to buy another central node. That saves money. So the same thing that killed wide spread wired mesh networks before makes wireless mesh networks so attractive today. Economics.",501,0,0,0
293,286,0,NA,6,"Mesh networks tend to give better local configuration options for an IoT network. Range extension was already mention which the mesh network as each device in the network will help make the network bigger than each device would be alone. Another important aspect is how the messages are routed. While some devices will remain stationary, others may be moved around. This could make routing messages in a typical way difficult, but a mesh network will be able to handle it better as all the nodes will be able to look for the device in question.A practical example of this in work is in a ZWave network you can rediscover all the nodes in your network so the controller and other nodes can figure out the best path for messages and which nodes can talk to which with and without relaying the message on a different device.

This snap must necessarily be produced and signed by the device brand, which is defined via the model assertion. The brand knows where and how that device will be used, and designs the gadget snap accordingly.  For example, the brand may know that the device is actually a special VM to be used on a particular cloud, or it may know that it is going to be manufactured in a particular factory.

The two inputs are:Regular switch for manual control.Output from an MCU for automatic or remote control.The circuit:Normally the switch should be open (input B is low just like on the image above) and the N-FET is driven by the MCU pin. When the MCU pin is low, then the XOR gate outputs low because the inputs match(both low) and the relay will be turned off. When the MCU pin is high, the relay will be turned on because the inputs are different.Now if the MCU crashes and its pin stucks in a state, then there are two cases:MCU pin stucks in high state and the relay remains turned on. In this case switch will give you an ability to control the relay as follows. If the switch is open then the relay will turned on, and if the switch is closed the relay will turned off.The MCU pin stucks in low state. In this case an open switch will turn off the relay and a closed will turn it on.Here is a simulation so you can check the mechanism yourself.

And that's what ensures interoperability.In particular, a certified product must register with a Z-Wave network controller. The latter gives out a 4 byte network / home ID to the former and also assigns to it a 1 byte node ID.The node ID ensures that each product registered to a controller's network would have its own communication channel - much like how an IP address allows a node in a LAN to communicate with others without confusion. This is why a controller can potentially handle 232 nodes (256 - some IDs that are most likely for internal use).On the other hand, the network ID ensures that each controller would have its own network and could coexist with other Z-Wave networks and controllers in close proximity.Although, since the network ID has 4 bytes, it would mean that if you have more than 256 ^ 4 controllers working in close proximity, then that would break this supposed interoperability.

326,66,1,62371,4,"I have reached a conclusion that the Bluetooth will be a better choice with its upcoming new release of Bluetooth 5. Reference. Kirkland, Washington – June 16, 2016 – The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced that its next release, coming late 2016 to early 2017, will be called Bluetooth 5 and will include significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity. Extending range will deliver robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality. Higher speeds will send data faster and optimize responsiveness. Increasing broadcast capacity will propel the next generation of “connectionless” services like beacons and location-relevant information and navigation. These Bluetooth advancements open up more possibilities and enable SIG companies – now at an all-time high of 30,000 member companies – to build an accessible, interoperable IoT.As others have pointed out I trade off bandwidth, range and cost. But with this new promising Bluetooth release I will get the following advantages according to Texas Instruments. And there probably won't be a trade off at all. Longer range will enable point-to-point and star networks to provide reliable, whole-house coverage for smart home applications such as security systems, lighting, smoke detectors and door locks. TI’s SimpleLink ultra-low power wireless MCUs provide industry leading RF performance to enable longer range and more robust connectivity today, and will introduce up to four times longer range with Bluetooth 5. Longer range will also be a huge advantage in mesh networks, reducing the number of hops necessary to transfer packets between nodes, which in turn reduces network congestion and improves stability. Higher speeds will enable data transfer at twice the rate while improving spectral and energy efficiency and enable new higher throughput applications such as audio. Transferring large amounts of data, for instance in medical, sports and fitness applications, will also be much faster providing a better overall user experience. When combined with data length extension in Bluetooth 4.2, which is already supported on CC2640 devices, higher speeds from Bluetooth 5 will provide 500 percent increased data throughput over Bluetooth 4.0. Today, TI’s CC2640 wireless MCU supports up to 5Mbps communication. Increased broadcasting capacity will allow beacons to transmit richer and more intelligent data to enable effortless and seamless location and navigation services.With these changes Bluetooth become a lot stronger and TI already offers a low power wireless MCU to start with. Though new smart phones and tablets should adopt to this new Bluetooth 5, but that should be only a matter of time.Further information about Bluetooth 5 can be found here.",427,0,2,0

However, further research suggests that training a neural network in a resource-constrained environment is a poor idea (see the answer to Is it possible to run a neural network on a microcontroller).Does this still apply for Cotton, Wilamowski and Dündar's approach that I linked? Would it be necessary to train a network designed for low resource usage on a more powerful device in my IoT network?For context, if I had a sensor transmitting the heat setting, I am considering a neural network as described in the paper to predict the desired boiler setting based on that and the time of day, etc. Training would be useful to change the neural network's outputs based on more data provided by the user.

Only there is a limitation on the maximum weights: Currently the limitation on the architecture embedded in this microcontroller is limited only by the number of weights needed. The neural network is currently limited to 256 weights. However for most embedded applications this 256 weight should not limit the system.As for training, as far as I understand the implementation described, the PIC controller receives parameters from an external source. The neural network forward calculations are written so that each neuron is calculated individually in a series of nested loops. The number of calculations for each loop and values for each node are all stored in a simple array in memory.  [...]  These arrays contain the architecture and the weights of the network. Currently, for demonstration purposes, these arrays are preloaded at the time the chip is programmed, but in the final version this would not be necessary. The microcontroller could easily be modified to contain a simple boot loader that makes use of the onboard RS232 serial port which would receive the data for the weights and topography from a remote location. This would allow for the weights or even the entire network  to be modified while the chip is in the field. I suspect that the training is performed externally as well.The paper also gives references for Neural Network Trainers which were probably used to determine the values preprogrammed into the PIC's memory.Wilamowski, B.

Thus a package with a graphical user interface has been developed in MATLAB for that purpose. This software allows the user to easily enter very complex architectures as well as initial weights, training parameters, data sets, and the choice of several powerful algorithms.I have to mention that the fully connected networks has lower weights number for a same task than a layer by layer architecture. That makes it more suitable for microcontrollers.I am not a neural network expert and it is quite complex so I can be wrong, but based on these papers I would say that Cotton, Wilamowski and Dündar's approach requires an external, more powerful platform to perform the training.",443,0,2,0

And here's how I would create a single numeric value I could compare across all options:Create a projected activity profile for the device (how often does it communicate and for how long) over a period - say over a week.Compute the current draw at the EM frequency used for the times over the selected period when communication is active - i.e. 10 uA draw (@ 900 MHz frequency) for a 2 s duration at 1000 x activity in a week would mean 20,000 uA-s / week.Compute the current draw for the times over the selected period when the device is at its default low power mode - i.e. 10 nA draw at [7 days x 24 hrs x 60 mins x 60 s - 1000 x 2 s activity] would mean 6,028 uA-s / week.Adding the 2 yields 26,028 uA-s / week current draw for this hypothetical MCU.This computed weekly current draw can then be compared for all MCUs.I know this is a very simplistic way of viewing the MCU activity - i.e. just considered 2 states: idle and communicating... but I believe any other states will have proportional and minor contributions to one of these 2. For instance, power used up for computations (instruction cycles) can be bundled along with the communicating state and will most likely have a very small contribution in terms of power as compared to the communication sub-system. The point is that, looking at these 2 states is sufficient for the selection process.",313,0,0,0

Sometimes it is necessary to subscribe to all messages, which are transferred over the broker, for example when persisting all of them into a database. This should not be done by using a MQTT client and subscribing to the multi level wildcard. The reason is that often the subscribing client is not able to process the load of messages that is coming its way. Especially if you have a massive throughput. Our recommended solution is to implement an extension in the MQTT broker, for example the plugin system of HiveMQ allows you to hook into the behavior of HiveMQ and add a asynchronous routine to process each incoming message and persist it to a database.Is there eithera similar system (extension/plugin) for the mosquitto broker,another recommended method that works with mosquitto, orreasonable evidence that this approach is unnecessary at all, i.e. that a client subscribing to # can do just fine?  does not address this question exhaustively.",215,0,2,0
339,228,0,NA,5," I want to reduce the need to flash everything and risk bricking the device completely as much as possible. Are there existing strategies when flashing microcontrollers over the air?Aside from your code that does the updating which would be relatively static, you need to keep two images in your storage: an active image and a backup image. Whenever, you need to update, do it in the backup, then switch that to be active. Once stable, update the old active image which should now be your backup.With that in mind, you can use wear-leveling algorithms when updating both images. The code for such algorithms might take around 10-15% of the total storage, but it's well worth it in extending the device's lifespan. Wear leveling is typically managed by the flash controller, which uses a wear leveling algorithm to determine which physical block to use each time data is programmed. There are two types of solid-state drive (SSD) wear leveling: dynamic and static. Dynamic wear leveling pools erased blocks and selects the block with the lowest erase count for the next write.  Static wear leveling, on the other hand, selects the target block with the lowest overall erase count, erases the block if necessary, writes new data to the block, and ensures that blocks of static data are moved when their block erase count is below a certain threshold. This additional step of moving data can slow write performance due to overhead on the flash controller, but static wear leveling is considerably more effective than dynamic wear leveling for extending the lifespan of solid state devices.(Techtarget.com: Wear leveling)",267,0,1,0

354,348,1,56806,5,"Yes and no.Both technologies are concerning different levels of providing connectivity. Usually mesh networking is provided by level 3 or 4 or even both of the ISO OSI model, depending on the extend of implementation. The network and transport layers provide the basic reliability of the mesh network. That reliability is usually not impeded when a node drops off.MQTT and AMQP are application layer protocols on level 7. Therefore these protocols are dependent on the reliability of the lower levels as far as the basic model goes. However it's always the prerogative of higher OSI levels to implement safeguards to cope with failures of the lower levels. For example the application can switch to a completely different network, like from Wi-Fi to 4G for example if it detects network failure. Smartphones do it all the time when we enter or leave a place with a configured Wi-Fi.There are also possibilities for the lower levels to accommodate for failures in upper levels. OSI level 4 load balancing for example can accommodate for failing nodes behind it. Of course, that requires that each nodes that can be addressed for load balancing and or failover solutions can provide the same service. Also obviously you need the central component at least twice. Since MQTT is basically application level routing based on topics that should be possible by simple duplication. This is an example of an MQTT cluster solution with the HiveMQ implementation.With that in mind it can be concluded that, no, the reliability on the network and transport levels cannot be negated by the choice of any higher level protocols. However that does not apply to the user experience. For the user the lower level protocols are just vehicles. Using an application layer protocol that has a single point of failure still means, that if that node is broken, then yes, the functionality is broken even though my network is still working.Anyhow, the application layer and above are responsible to provide the reliability to the user. Mesh networks can only deliver the basics. There is one final thing to consider. Unless one has redundancies for every component, there are always use cases that have single points of failure.

I've checked compatibility for you using the compatibility checker and both your devices are listed as supported, and your method of using the Pi may be similarly expensive (but will also require the trouble of designing the software and finding the IR codes):Raspberry Pi 3 Model B - £32.99From the guide you linked, here are the other parts required:Adafruit Protoboard - £10.13Two IR LEDs - £0.334 eachTwo LED holders - £0.097 eachTransistor - £0.08310 kOhm resistor - £0.167IR receiver - £0.471Hook-up Wire Spool Set - $15.95 ≈ £13 as of December 2016(full model names omitted, and prices quoted as cheapest when this post was written for 1 unit)When you total these, the price comes to approximately £57.70, which saves £41.30 compared to the Logitech Harmony Hub, but you will have to spend time designing the software to control the IR transmitter/receiver and the Alexa skill. Alternatively, if you decide to integrate it with SmartThings with the ZigBee/Z-Wave components you listed, the totals will be approximately £84 and £114 for the whole device (the latter is more than the £99 Logitech Hub!).You may be able to reduce the price significantly, though, by using a more simple microcontroller, since I doubt it will be so complex that a Raspberry Pi 3 would be required.In summary, if you're in for a challenge and don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could save quite a lot of money by designing it yourself (as long as you avoid the really expensive components).

433,414,0,NA,10,"I know you want to use the plug to shut off the entire media center to eliminate the expense (and waste) of the standby power draw, but I would strongly recommend the simpler solution of leaving the TV plugged in 24/7, and triggering your TV's power setting using the same event that activates your smart plug. Power/CostModern LCD or OLED TVs sip about half a watt of current in standby, or less. According to your TV's manual (on page 100), your TV draws 0.2W of power in standby. Using your figure of 0.28€/kW as a cost of electricity, the standby power drawn by your TV will add no more than 0.49€ per year to your electric bill. Given the life of a TV may be 20 years, that means your workaround would have to cost less than 10.00€ to ever pay for itself. Furthermore, your TV will consume electricity at the full-power rate of 131/kWh during the entire system's cold boot sequence, which probably takes more time than a warm boot. (The longer it takes your whole system to boot up to ""watchable TV"", the more useless electricity it draws; similarly, I've found that family members are typically less pleased the longer it takes for the TV to power up.)Financially, there is little reason to pursue this. Environmentally, it is probably not as advantageous as you think.SafetySmart plugs are not rated to isolate their plugged-in devices from lightning strikes, so merely shutting off the smart plug won't protect the TV from surges or spikes.PrivacyIf you're concerned about privacy and network activity while your smart TV is supposed to be ""powered off"", go into your TV's settings and disable the phone home capabilities. If you're still worried, powering it off won't help because they leak personal data when they're on (and you're watching it), not when they're in standby. In that case you should instead fix the leak by shielding the TV behind a network firewall that prevents it from ever reporting back to the factory. ",335,0,0,0
434,-1,NA,2351,5,"I have recently read an article about why IoT should switch from the now dominant centralized (server - client) model to a decentralized peer-to-peer solution.Reasons against centralization: Connection between devices will have to exclusively go through the internet, even if they happen to be a few feet apart.  [...]  it will not be able to respond to the growing needs of the huge IoT ecosystems of tomorrow  [...]  Existing IoT solutions are expensive because of the high infrastructure and maintenance cost associated with centralized clouds, large server farms and networking equipment. The sheer amount of communications that will have to be handled when IoT devices grow to the tens of billions will increase those costs substantially.  [...]  Even if the unprecedented economical and engineering challenges are overcome, cloud servers will remain a bottleneck and point of failure that can disrupt the entire network. This is especially important as more critical tasks such as human health and life will become dependent on IoT.Instead the article suggests a decentralized approach to IoT networking using peer-to-peer communication. But: However, establishing peer-to-peer communications will present its own set of challenges, chief among them the issue of security.Other source, like How Is P2P Becoming the IoT Nightmare? also mentions security as a problem.

435,395,1,65513,7,"A lot of people have struggled with this. No charter appears to be forthcoming, because the interests of the cloud providers lies in locking their hardware users in, based on the potential future profits to be made from subscribers. The more dependent you are upon their cloud, the more you'll be theoretically willing to pay for continued service (note that payment already includes non-monetary transactions such as targeted advertising and data collection.) So don't expect any of the cloud-based solutions to champion an exit strategy.So for now, you can overcome your reluctance by taking matters into your own hands. Your best defense is to purchase independent items that comply with standards (open or proprietary), as opposed to being run by proprietary clouds. Let's look at three examples: cloud-based, proprietary network, open network.Cloud-basedAssureLink is a proprietary wireless network that uses a home hub to connect to a cloud-based service to provide remote access to one brand of garage door openers. When these openers were released on the market, a subscription to AssureLink cost $19.00 per year, and there were few sales. The company dropped charging for the service so they haven't gone away, but there is always concern that once they've saturated the market, the company will have no reason to continue the service, at which point the devices would become useless. This concern is not without merit.Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit has thrust them into the spotlight, but Revolv was the previous poster child for IoT devices being bricked by their parent company. The Revolv home hub connected to a proprietary cloud service. Google bought Nest, and then bought Revolv to get some of the people. They saw Revolv as splintering the home automation market away from Nest so they shut it down, bricking every Revolv home controller.Is this true for all cloud-based hardware? Apple, Google, and Amazon are all as stable as any provider can be. But Revolv sure looked good when Google first bought them; Nest is reportedly in disarray internally (and Google's new hub is pitted directly against Nest's philosophy), and you only have to look as far as Microsoft's Zune or Phone to see that being big doesn't mean that a centralized service will remain successful over the life of your devices. Proprietary P2P network standardZ-Wave is an example of a proprietary mesh network technology. Z-Wave devices can talk to each other, but each device requires a communications chip licensed by a single company. Development and per-chip licenses are ridiculously expensive, so the price of the devices will never come down until the patents expire, and even then only if someone else enters the market to compete with them. However, once you have a Z-Wave device, it will continue to work with new and old Z-Wave devices.Open P2P networkWiFi based cameras are a good example of devices based on open network technology. Apps for smart phones can connect directly to the camera, no cloud required, no expensive licensed technology. However, these have drawbacks. In order to use these devices without a cloud, the installer has to configure their router/firewall to enable remote access. And as we've seen with the Mirai botnet, these devices are responsible for their own security but not all do a good job of it, and they even put the rest of your network at risk.The future with Open SourceThe open source answer to this are projects like OpenHab, Domoticz, mosquitto, and others. Instead of a proprietary cloud, you run the P2P devices from your own server. Only the server is exposed to the internet, and for the most part these are positioned to be better hardened. At this point this approach is still very much in its infancy, and all the solutions so far require some technical skills to set up and maintain a home network.However, by focusing on P2P devices today, whether they use an open or closed protocol, you are at least investing in building your own infrastructure that will work free of the dependency on proprietary external services. You can even get started with a proprietary home hub, as long as the devices are communicating via a P2P standard that exists beyond a single company. The open source solutions can't get any worse than they are right now, and are rapidly improving.",712,0,0,0
438,131,0,NA,9,"There are a few things that really distinguish Z-Wave and ZigBee from each other.FrequencyThe first (as Eirik M noted) is the frequency on which they operate. Z-Wave operates within the 915 MHz ISM band. This gives it reasonable penetration of building materials (better than Wi-Fi) and good overall distance. The fact that few other household devices use that band (now that 900 MHz cordless phones are less widespread) means there's also less interference.ZigBee can operate at either 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz.1 2.4 GHz is a busy band; it's where Wi-Fi and microwave ovens (among other things) operate. That means that 2.4 GHz ZigBee devices are subject to more interference than 915 MHz Z-Wave and ZigBee devices. They also don't go through walls as readily. (The 2.4 GHz band does give higher bit rates, which is why WiFi lives there (and also uses the 5 GHz band), but most IoT devices don't need to transfer lots of data quickly, so the lower bandwidth of the 915 MHz band isn't a drawback.)1 915 MHz is only used in North America. Although 2.4 GHz is available worldwide, ZigBee's lower frequency band varies from one regulatory region to another. The various bands are mostly in the 700 MHz to 900 MHz range, so the statements about the 915 MHz North American band are generally applicable to other regions, too.OpennessZigBee is an open standard, though you need to join the ZigBee alliance (for a fee), if you want to sell ZigBee devices. Z-Wave is a licensed proprietary standard, although the high-level protocol is documented publicly. If you want to make Z-Wave hardware, you have to license the specification from the Z-Wave Alliance and then have your device tested for compliance to the standard. If you buy a Z-Wave device with an appropriately-programmable interface, you can use the already-licensed hardware with the public protocol specification to write your own software.PriceBecause of the lower barrier to entry, ZigBee devices can often be less expensive than Z-Wave devices with the same functionality. Consumer IoT hardware can vary widely in price for many other reasons, of course.InteroperabilityZ-Wave devices tend to have better interoperability overall. When new versions of the Z-Wave standard have been released, they've maintained backward compatibility; any Z-Wave device should be able to communicate sensibly with any other Z-Wave device, regardless of the age or manufacturer of each. (Obviously, newer protocol features won't be present, but the older functionality will be preserved.) Interoperability testing is part of the Z-Wave compliance process. ZigBee doesn't have as rigorous a testing regimen, so it sometimes happens that two ZigBee devices that should be able to talk to each other cannot, due to implementation flaws in one or both devices.On top of that, ZigBee supports a number of different profiles which all share the same underlying protocol but use different communication details. (This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.) Most IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems. As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them. (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)The ZigBee Alliance is currently in the process of developing a new iteration of the ZigBee protocol named ZigBee 3.0. It looks like part of the new specification's goal will be to increase interoperability among ZigBee devices. We'll have to see how that goes, though. There doesn't seem to e a timetable for finalization of the new standard yet, though.SimilaritiesAs long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks. Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller. (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols. Notwithstanding the stuff in the ""Openness"" section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other. (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.) Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network.",815,0,0,0
439,-1,NA,31320,6,"Thread have produced a document about their protocol, Thread Stack Fundamentals, which I've been reading to try and understand more about how Thread works.On page 5, the document explains that despite having no single point of failure, a Leader is needed to make decisions for the network: A Router or Border Router can assume a Leader role for certain functions in the Thread Network. This Leader is required to make decisions within the network. For example, the Leader assigns Router addresses and allows new Router requests. The Leader role is elected and if the Leader fails, another Router or Border Router assumes the Leader role. It is this autonomous operation that ensures there is no single point of failure. How is the Leader elected by the devices in the Thread network? Is there a set of criteria that are evaluated when the devices 'vote' for or select the Leader?",148,0,1,0

Basically, the first eligible router node self-designates as the leader.In other words, when a node is added, if it is unable to find a leader in the system, it will automatically designate itself as the leader. Otherwise, it will fall into line under the existing leader node. I quote from the article referenced above: Router Eligible nodes become routers if they are needed to support the mesh. The first Router Eligible node to form the network will be autonomously designated a router as well as the Leader. A Leader performs additional network management tasks and makes decisions on behalf of the network. Other Router Eligible nodes in the network can assume the role of a Leader, but there is only one Leader per network at a given time.In other words, it's a one man machine election.

441,434,1,2351,5,"Although decentralised networks often look appealing as a solution, there are a few compelling advantages of centralised networks which make them far more popular at the minute.Design OverheadUnderstanding, programming and setting up a decentralised network is often much more challenging than a traditional centralised (client-server) model in the majority of cases. Take, for example, a mesh network (the topology used by ZigBee, Z-Wave and Thread), which tends to be structured like so:(image from Wikipedia, in the public domain)Nodes in the network must be capable of sending messages for themselves, but they must also be able to route messages across the network, which is more more complex, since each node must be able to calculate a route to the destination. The IETF has a rather interesting presentation on the routing protocols used in 6LoWPAN, a mesh network protocol that uses IPv6. As you can see, the design is far more involved than a traditional star network connected to a Wi-Fi router, and of course each node will need more computational power to handle the additional processing steps needed to participate in the mesh network.The main problem of all of this is that each node will require more processing power, and hence cost more. A TechTarget article addresses this more generally: Centralization is an attempt to improve efficiency by taking advantage of potential economies of scale: improving the average; it may also improve reliability by minimizing opportunities for error. Decentralization is an attempt to improve speed and flexibility by reorganizing to increase local control and execution of a service: improving the best case. The other side effect will be that the increased computation will lead to a higher power consumption (although this tradeoff may not be that significant compared to long-range transmissions which would otherwise be necessary).SecurityUnless security is built-in to the design of the decentralised protocol, it can easily pose a big problem. Since nodes will be passing data between each other, it's difficult to guarantee the integrity of each packet, since one router node could easily replace one packet with another, and the receiver would never be able to tell the difference. A Chron article describes this issue well: If a computer becomes infected or malicious computer enters a mesh network, it can pretend to be a trusted member of that network and then modify sent data and disrupt how the network passes information. In a black hole attack, information passing through the infected computer will not continue through the network, blocking the flow of data. In gray hole attacks, some data may be blocked, while other data is allowed, making it seem like the computer is still a working part of the network. Wormhole attacks are harder to detect: They tunnel into a network computer from the outside and pretend to be other nodes in the network, essentially becoming invisible nodes. They can then monitor network traffic as it passes from one node to the next.Economies of ScaleLarge cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure allow you to set up a centralised server for a price that is dirt cheap - Amazon and Microsoft have the benefit of running truly immense server farms which allows them to provide server space for a very low price. Have a play with the Azure pricing calculator to see what I mean - you can run a function 1 million times in a month, using 128MB of RAM and taking 5 seconds per execution for £2.20/month, and scaling up the capacity is trivially easy.On the other hand, scaling up a decentralised network requires adding more and more nodes, and I expect that you would start to see diseconomies of scale, since the nodes would need to spend more and more time routing data rather than performing useful computation.In summary, although decentralised networks looks like a perfect solution, they do have significant disadvantages, which is why many IoT developers still favour centralised solutions.",648,0,2,0

465,463,0,NA,7,"What Internet of Everything's aim is: connecting the unconnected — people-to-people (P2P), machine-to-people (M2P), and machine-to-machine (M2M) — via the Internet of Everything (IoE).So basically it seems to be a broader term, the next generation of IoT according to Cisco.The point is that all devices will have direct connection to the Internet, while in IoT the devices are members of an Internet-Like-Network but not necessarily the Internet itself.What makes it possible is the IPv6 which will allow countless devices to have its own IP address. Second, barriers to connectedness continue to drop. For example, IPv6 overcomes the IPv4 limit by allowing for  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 more people, processes, data, and things to be connected to the Internet. Amazingly, IPv6 creates enough address capacity for every star in the known universe to have 4.8 trillion addresses.So IoE emphasizes TCP/IP connection and larger, more comprehensive networks.But all in all there are not much differences at all. Using only TCP/IP in IoE exclude a lot of IoT platforms and devices but the concept does not change much.Also the targeted connection of M2M, P2P, M2P does not make a significant difference either.

466,460,1,24699,8,"The technical answer to is this security unbreakable? is ""no"". The primary reason is that biometric attributes are not secrets. Some are easily duplicated, like fingerprints, or images of faces. Some are harder to spoof, like irises. But once a biometric attribute is captured, it can be replayed. And biometric attributes are fixed. If a user's attribute is ever copied, you obviously can't tell the user ""we've had a breach, change your iris.""It is highly unlikely that an average thief will be able to spoof all of the biometric sensors simultaneously. However, it would not be impossible for a dedicated, sophisticated attacker to engineer such a feat.In addition to sensor spoofing, it may be possible to perform a replay attack using the data emitted by the sensors. However, this would be implementation dependent, and one would expect a company to architect the security of their devices against this type of attack. This is where the IoT approach might provide worse security than an integrated solution. If the sensors are unrelated to each other, an attacker could compromise one device at a time without raising suspicion. The attacker can practice with a fake gummi-bear fingerprint until he gets that perfected, then he use that fake fingerprint while he practices with a photo to fool the image sensor. An integrated sensor could be architected to require all attributes to be present at the same time; the IoT approach could be implemented in a piecemeal fashion, with vulnerabilities created by the gaps between the systems.Practically, this approach still sounds very secure, and would be better security than a simple passcode or a single biometric measurement.

480,-1,NA,7932,4,"I've been reading about the 6LoWPAN protocol (which is used by Thread, among other network protocols), and it seems to be highly useful for networking, and has the advantage of allowing each device to easily be addressable.Wikipedia says that 6LoWPAN uses a form of header compression to reduce transmission size (hence saving time and energy): The target for IP networking for low-power radio communication is applications that need wireless internet connectivity at lower data rates for devices with very limited form factor. An example is automation and entertainment applications in home, office and factory environments. The header compression mechanisms standardized in RFC6282 can be used to provide header compression of IPv6 packets over such networks.It refers to RFC 6282 as the compression format used. The abstract is rather brief in how it works: The compression format relies on shared context to allow compression of arbitrary prefixes. How the information is maintained in that shared context is out of scope.As far as I can tell, 'shared context' is used to elide some header fields and save space. How, exactly, is this 'shared context' managed, and why doesn't every IPv6 device (e.g. my computer) use this compression?",194,0,0,0
483,480,1,7932,2,"The RFC draft explains a bit better how the header compression works. What is described as arbitrary prefixes in the abstract is essentially a bunch of information that is assumed to be in a certain range or having a specific value. Thus, making transmitting those information unnecessary. To enable effective compression LOWPAN_IPHC relies on information pertaining to the entire 6LoWPAN.This assumption goes for the entire 6LoWPAN, breaking down the next sentence we have six information that are assumed to be known or in a considerably smaller range of values.   Version is 6;  Traffic Class and Flow Label are both zero;  Payload Length can be inferred from lower layers from either the 6LoWPAN Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header;  Hop Limit will be set to a well-known value by the source;  addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces will be formed using the link-local prefix or a small set of routable prefixes assigned to the entire 6LoWPAN;  addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces are formed with an IID derived directly from either the 64-bit extended or 16-bit short IEEE 802.15.4 addresses. (Bullet points by me, otherwise continuing section three of the draft.)This also explains why this compression is not used by devices like your PC. Your PC has to be able to address the whole world basically. However the compression as described above is only really effective if used in a sufficiently constrained environment—the entire 6LoWPAN—and not the world. In the best case, the LOWPAN_IPHC can compress the IPv6 header down to two octets (the dispatch octet and the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding) with link-local communication.(Still same draft section)As described in the RFC draft the compression gets even better when it's in a more constricted environment. For link local only it's down to two octets. Of course, we want our usual computers and end devices to be able to address everything else instead. However, if we want to be able to change all those values this compression takes as granted it doesn't work anymore. We'd have a mismatch between what we mean and what every other network participant thinks we mean, because the compression takes values for granted.Thus, the compression severely limits the vast possibilities of IPv6 to reach smaller headers and gain efficiency in time and energy in a very well defined small environment.",386,0,0,0

Some people might wish she did otherwise.Unwanted PurchasesSince your Echo will be linked to an Amazon account, you may wish to disable voice purchasing to avoid children from unexpectedly buying things and leaving you a hefty bill to pay. Through the Alexa app, you can disable voice purchasing trivially easily.MannersThis may seem a rather odd point, but some people object to the fact that Alexa will not encourage you to say 'please' and 'thank you'. It seems rather unusual to worry about this in my opinion, but some people are concerned that since Alexa will respond even if you rudely command it, young children will start to believe that it is acceptable to just order people around.There is no software solution to this - you will simply have to encourage your children to be nice!Overall, although there aren't any built-in parental controls, you should be relatively safe to use it around your children, provided that you take the precautions before letting your children use the device. Amazon know that many people have purchased an Echo specifically for their children, so it seems likely that they'll continue to enforce some protections such as the profanity filter. Can a skill set be developed/made available to implement Parental Control?Not without great difficulty. Expanding on my comment, you wouldn't be able to set any restrictions through a skill, because custom skills seem to be self-contained and can only respond when they are invoked. Unless you wanted to write a new, parental control-supporting skill for every feature you need, I don't think it's possible to create parental controls through an Alexa skill.",502,0,2,0
543,-1,NA,11521,4,"The OpenFog Consortium, a group that is working on an open fog computing specification, has published a white paper about their architecture.They define a fog node as: The physical and logical network element that implements fog computing services. It is somewhat analogous to a server in cloud computing.However, I'm having a bit of trouble intuitively understanding what a fog node would be. Would it just be a server or hub device hosted locally on your own network, rather than in a massive server farm? Would a smart home hub (like a SmartThings Hub) be a very simple example of a fog node under the OpenFog definition?",105,0,0,0

So, in the Alexa model, audio could be streamed continuously to a server in the cloud, or all of the audio processing (not just the hot-word detection) can be performed at the node.The important distinction of a fog node seems to be that the upstream bandwidth is reduced compared with the local bandwidth, so it is likely that audio or image processing is being performed.Based on this definition, I think even an intelligent protocol bridge is not quite a fog-node (but the hardware which is used may well be capable of performing fog-node functions) - thinking of my lightwave-rf WiFi link...",175,0,0,0
545,543,1,11521,4,"What it looks like they're trying to do is establish semantic definitions for messages and rules that can be interpreted or processed at any layer, and that the layers can be migrated up or down. So yes, a home hub could be a fog node, but only if it supports the fog behaviors and messages.Think of a typical home automation architecture:You trigger the remote and it sends a Z-wave message to the switch, which turns on the light. You can configure your home hub to send a message to the switch based on other rules (the garage door is opened.) And your watch can talk to your phone which can contact the company's cloud, which sends the message to your home hub, which sends it to your light switch.Today, you can do the first part of this by setting up a scene in your light switch that is triggered by a paired remote. Using Z-wave, no home hub is needed. You can add a home hub and set up a new scene to trigger the light switch if the remote's button is pressed, but you better delete the scene in the light switch first. You can use a cloud interface to configure your hub's behavior, perhaps triggering your hub via IFTTT. And you can also use your phone to contact a web interface on the cloud and have it turn on the switch.What OpenFog is aiming to do is to have those device definitions be universal, the rules be platform independent, and the messages be transport independent. They'll share common security and authentication methods. That means you set it up once, no matter where you are, and the definitions and rules are migrated up and down the architecture. From your phone you could view your devices, which would include the light switch and remote control, and say ""I want button 1 on the remote to toggle the light switch"". The rules might be created right there in your phone, then transported to the cloud server. The cloud server could examine the inputs and decide ""All the responsibility for lights and remotes belongs at a lower level"", and push the rules down to the home hub. The home hub could say ""hey, Z-wave knows how to run a scene in this model of light switch, so I will push these rules to the light switch and remote."" Next time you push the button on the remote, the signal will be caught by the light switch and the light will turn on. This would provide the fastest possible response time (no hub needed). And by having the rules backed up at a cloud level, if you have to replace a defective light switch, none of the rules need to change. They'd just be pushed back down to the replacement switch.OpenFog also will provide for elastic scale. Let's say you place 1000 light switches in an office building, using a network technology that has a latency that goes up exponentially based on the number of nodes. It could scale communications such that the 1000 nodes are split into 10 networks, so that no network ever has a latency longer than 200 milliseconds. It also specifies scalability of control. If you've ever worked with systems built for GUI control you get used to instructions like these: ""right click on the node, pick 'settings', then set intensity to '75%', then 'OK'"". Such instructions are worse than useless when it comes to managing 60,000 nodes. OpenFog should enable automated groupings of nodes allowing scalable control. ""For all nodes in Eastern Standard Time zone, set intensity to 75%,"" or ""For all nodes in profit center 12, set intensity to 65%.""It also specifies autonomy where possible. If the Peoria, Illinois branch replaces a furnace vent duct control, it shouldn't require an HQ person to delete the old control unit ID, then add the replacement ID. The local maintenance person should be able to do that herself. The security still has to ensure that the furnace repair person doesn't have the authority to disable the burglar alarm sensors on the back door. Now, place all of this behind open standards so that a Honeywell burglar alarm and a Trane heating system all interoperate in the same logical network as your Philips light bulbs, Leviton Z-wave switches, and your Fitbit scale.So, is your SmartThings hub an OpenFog node? Not today, and it won't be unless and until it implements and interoperates with these standards. But a future home hub certainly could be an OpenFog node.",754,1,0,0

Although the concept is not new, this level of integration, and the aggressive power targets make this an evolving market.Pay close attention to the power states which are offered, viewed from the perspective of your whole system (regulators, oscilators, sensor signal conditioning). It is possible (unlikely) that your 2 min active state will benefit from a less deep sleep than the normal operating state.The lowest power useful state should account for the majority of your energy consumption. Exactly how this pans out for you depends on things like if you can operate directly off power without a regulator, minimum operating voltage, etc.For the active state, consider your most RAM or compute intensive operations and benchmark them using the nearest equivalent off-the-shelf parts you can find (based on CPU, speed and memory architecture). In your application it seems that preparing the payload and encryption may be fairly trivial, but in general this isn't an obvious assumption. Retention states might permit sensor integration without state save/restore for example.Match the clock speed and architecture to the demands of your application. In sleep state, you save leakage power. Lower target clock speeds for a device may mean it needs to remain in an active state for longer, but also result in a design achieving better leakage performance (as well as maybe lower operating voltage).You won't know the absolute best design until you have iterated more than one design - there are just too many parameters (and by this time, your product will be starting to get old), so higher level aspects of the design flow are still important.

It is the successor to, and convergence of, 3 previous standards: EHS, BatiBUS and EIB.KNX is currently the de facto standard in building automation in Europe. The KNX Association had 339 members/manufacturers from 37 countries. The KNX Association has partnership agreements with more than 30,000 installer companies in 100 countries and more than 60 technical universities as well as over 150 training centres. Member companies have more than 7000 KNX certified product in their catalogues.Until recently, KNX did not have support for support for TCP. While there has been an IP based implementation of KNX named KNXNet for quite a while now, this protocol uses UDP as the transport layer, which is not very programmer-friendly and rather poorly supported in comparison with TCP.Only recently did the KNX Association release a KNX Standard extension for KNX web services. This means that there is now an official standard for implementing RESTful web services, which makes it far easier to integrate the KNX eco-system with other technology:The KNX WS specification foresees three flavors to ease the integration with an existing ecosystem: oBIX, BACnet/WS and OPC/UA.

568,-1,NA,4230,11,"IoT enabled light bulbs have been on the market for a while now. The Philips Hue is probably the best known. But I think controlling bulbs directly is a rule-maintenance disaster waiting to happen. If a bulb goes out (and yes, LED bulbs do fail), you have to replace the bulb, and remember to update any scenes or other rules that control the bulb (or are triggered by the bulb.) Or if you move a bulb from fixture A in the kitchen to fixture B in the bedroom, (perhaps while cleaning), the rule that says ""Turn on kitchen lights"" will now illuminate the bedroom.That may not seem like a big problem today for those of us who understand the configurations of our home automation systems intimately, but imagine a home automation system set up by a professional integrator for a typical customer. The homeowner may not know how to change the rules, so replacing a lightbulb could cost them not only the price of the smart bulb, but an additional service call charge from the integration company. A smart switch or fixture solves this problem because the switch doesn't move with typical maintenance. (The switch offers the same problem of configuration if it fails and needs to be replaced, of course, but switches typically have better life expectancies than bulbs, which are generally considered consumables.)On the other hand, an IoT enabled light switch can't fully control every aspect of lighting the same way a smart light bulb can. A switch can do simple dimming for certain technologies of bulbs, but it can't control the color of the Hue bulb. Much worse, smart switches use different types of electronic circuitry to perform dimming, and must be carefully matched to the technology of the bulbs they are controlling. A typical older dimmer can dim only incandescent bulbs and not CFL or LED bulbs; some dimmers can dim both incandescent and CFL but not LED bulbs; some dimmers can control incandescent bulbs and LED bulbs, but not CFLs; and some dimmers can control inductive loads like halogen transformers, but not CFLs or LEDs! With incandescent bulbs being replaced because they're such energy wasters, this has been a real problem, too.So what's the most practical approach?

572,568,1,4230,7,"There are a few aspects to consider, and the answer will depend a lot on your exact situation.CustomisationSmart switches will allow far more choice in lighting overall, since you can use any bulb that would work normally. As noted in this CNet article: With a smart switch, you're free to use whatever bulb you want -- perfect if you're picky about light quality, or if your fixture requires bulbs of a particular size, shape, or style that's incompatible with smart bulbs.However, the customisation issue goes the other way too. With a 'smart bulb' such as the Philips Hue, you gain the ability to change the bulb colour as well as the brightness and on/off state. With a smart switch, I would imagine that colour changing is impractical, because the switch is 'dumb' and doesn't know what's connected to it, just like your regular light switch.Installation/SetupThis is another issue with advantages and disadvantages for both options. A smart switch will need to be wired in to the lighting circuit to control your lights, which is nowhere near as straightforward as simply plugging in a bulb, as with most smart bulbs. Of course, if the bulb doesn't fit in the first place, you're going to have a problem using the smart bulb, but most light fixtures use standard sizes.On the other hand, a smart bulb is likely to need more setup, and some require a hub as well, which adds to the setup time and complexity. The majority of smart switches on the market seem to connect via Wi-Fi, and hence do not require an additional hub.CostThis is a far more difficult issue to quantify, since there is such a diverse range of products on the market. I've just picked some relatively popular products for the example, and this will vary widely depending on the exact products chosen.The Philips Hue starter kit, which provides three bulbs and a hub, costs $199.99.To compare, the WeMo Light Switch is $47.94 (each), so $143.82 for 3 switches. However, you do not get the dimming and colour changing options with this, so it may be worth deciding whether those functions are worth the additional $56.17.'Graceful degradation'Many smart bulbs will simply stop working altogether if you turn the proper light switch off, because they require power to operate, so they can't respond to wireless control. A smart switch won't have this problem - it's always connected to power and ready to respond - so it will be far more intuitive to the users of your system to use smart switches.I also heard a highly useful rule of thumb when designing a smart home - it should be simple enough that both a 5-year-old and and 80-year-old can understand it without needing to be taught. In the case of a smart switch, you'll have no problems - it works just like any other switch, and toggling it will toggle the light, whether physically or wirelessly. A smart bulb might fail this test - switching it off physically then on wirelessly doesn't work, which is likely to confuse anyone who finds this problem.The rule of thumb I mentioned is helpful to ensure that your IoT architecture doesn't get so complex that you can't operate it normally. In other words, if you can't operate your lights like you could before, you're doing it wrong!In summary, think about these points and decide which is best for you:Do you need dimming and colour changing? If so, pick a smart bulb.Are you able to wire up a smart switch electrically, and want the choice of any 'dumb' bulb to use in your lights? If this is the case, pick a smart switch.Above all, I'd suggest not mixing the two systems together - this way, the user of the home can learn how the system works and all their lights will work the same way - mixing two systems will lead to more confusion for little gain.",652,0,2,0

581,579,0,NA,4,"These problems are always tricky to figure out. The approach I take is to first document each network interface on each device, including routers, access points, and POWERlan adapters. Record the MAC address, IP address, default gateway, netmask, and hostname. Now, go to your main DHCP server (probably in your home router) and make sure its logs show the exact same MAC addresses you recorded, and that each MAC was issued the exact same IP addresses you saw. A difference may mean you've accidentally enabled a second DHCP server (perhaps hidden in a cheap access point, WiFi range extender, or POWERlan adapter) which could be creating false network settings in some of your devices, slicing your network in two. Make sure all your devices are in the same subnet. That means they all have the same netmask, and the topmost bits are all the same as each other. For example, if your router's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then all your devices should have their top 3 octets in common with the default gateway and each other, such as 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, and 192.168.1.3In a small home network such as you've described, I'd expect all devices to share a common default gateway.

From TrustedReviews.com: The Core is a combination of Symantec's pre-existing security knowhow and some new features we’ve not seen before. The router will inspect every packet of data that passes through it for known pieces of malware and other naughties. This is a common feature in business networking products but is seldom found in kit for use in the home.In short, it's a kind of firewall which is right on the entrypoint to your home, so it filters all traffic going to and from your home. Therefore, even if an individual computer's security is compromised, there is a second line of defence. As @jpmc26 mentioned in the comments below, it is certainly not a fail-proof security wall: malicious hackers can take other routes. However, it helps tighten up the security on your network in case the security on an individual device is compromised temporarily.2. Frequent updates. According to the Norton Community, updates are run hourly, meaning that security compromises can be rapidly dealt with on a home level.3. Multiple networking. You will be able to set up more than one network, so that any hacking would have to move through your router to another network, allowing for more detailed screening. Back on the Trusted Reviews page, apparently... You'll also be able to move your most vulnerable devices, such as smart home kit, onto a completely separate network, making it much harder for a compromised device to open the door to the rest of your home network.4.

599,593,0,NA,3,"I'm pleased to see that this product exists, and hope that other vendors of routers follow suit.The solution to recent consumer IoT security problems lies in the intelligence of the home network that is wrapped in the router. We will never get cheap-as-possible manufacturers to implement some yet-to-be-defined security protocol. And, as much as we try and educate consumers, people will buy on price, not security (which may be too complex for them to understand).It's easy to solve the problem at the network level. Less trustworthy devices can be put on a separate network, where leaking of wifi passwords causes less of a problem, devices can be firewalled, and traffic can be monitored. Although this could, in theory, be done with existing routers, it requires a level of networking skill, and interest/desire to maintain the network, that does not exist with most consumers.The solution is better UIs so that consumers can interact with routers in a way that hides complexity, and more 'intelligence', possibly packaged as 'home networking as a service'. The Norton Core seems to be doing (at least) these two things, and as a result goes a long way to improving home network security, which in turn reduces the risk of rogue IoT devices.So while people with networking skills and interests may find better products to solve their problems, for the average consumer, the Norton Core seems to be a move in the right direction.",236,0,0,0

(For the uninitiated, Finger normally reports whether a specified user is logged in, and if so where.) Since Finger requests are part of standard ARPANET (now Internet) protocols, people could check the Coke machine from any CMU computer by saying ""finger coke@cmua"".

Not that it would do you much good if you were a few thousand miles away...For the first generation Coke Machine, in the 70s and 80s, the finger command was (ab)used while connecting through ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet. Not exactly a complex protocol, but it worked well enough to indicate the state of the coke machine without being overly difficult to set up.If you're interested in exactly how the finger command worked, here is an extract from Wikipedia detailing how it operates: The finger daemon runs on TCP port 79. The client will (in the case of remote hosts) open a connection to port 79. An RUIP (Remote User Information Program) is started on the remote end of the connection to process the request. The local host sends the RUIP one line query based upon the Finger query specification, and waits for the RUIP to respond. The RUIP receives and processes the query, returns an answer, then initiates the close of the connection. The local host receives the answer and the close signal, then proceeds closing its end of the connection.The finger command can also provide some custom information, such as full name, email address, and some custom text.

For example, the easiest way I can imagine is as follows; all it would need is a phone or similar with NFC capabilities. (Only hypothetically, because this assumes NFC etc can do it!)User powers up IoT deviceUser holds phone against IoT device's NFC padIoT device asks phone for WiFi credentialsIoT device uses credentials to connect to WiFiIoT device directs phone's browser to its URLBut right away I can see possible flaws: Phone is unlikely to want to give credentials away; security risk.Phone is unlikely to want to navigate to the given URL; security risk.NFC probably doesn't have defined standards for these kinds of operations; even if security issues are mitigated (e.g. by asking user permission), I can't believe I'd be lucky enough for this to be implemented. So an app would have to be downloaded for the phone to do all this. Which means an app would need to be written for Apple, another for Android etc, plus in the case of Apple it would have to be approved, and either way the user would have to search for it, install it and learn how to use it - all defeating the purpose of having a web interface. Obviously some users will not have NFC-compatible phones, so there would also have to be a secondary method. The only awareness of a solution I have comes from how my WiFi IP security camera works. It requires first connecting it via Ethernet cable to a router with on a 192.168.1.X subnet with a given IP reserved (e.g. my camera required 192.168.1.100 to be reserved or free). Then from there, the user navigates to , logs in with the camera's supplied username and password, then from there, configures the camera with the WiFi access point name and password. But that method had one serious disadvantage: it required that the router operates on the subnet 192.168.1.X. Mine operated on 192.168.0.X. Thankfully I was able to reconfigure it. But my new router doesn't have that ability!! I would have been stuck. Additionally, the above method is quite a pain; quite a few steps.

652,648,0,NA,1," I am trying to develop a security gadget which can be wearable. Congratulations. This sounds like a good idea. The first thing to worry about is power. Wait! Actually, that is the second. The fist is whether you want to create a new device, or whether it might not be better/easier to develop an app for a smartphone. But can be operate remotely from any location in the world using its GPS ID. You need to define “operate”.I am going to make a guess that you are trying to track the device (which is NOT the same as tracking the device owner), by their GPS location. Is that all that you want to do? Just track the wearer? Or maybe you want them to be able to trigger an alarm? Anything else?If you want to make your own gadget, then AdaFruit have a good line in wearables which you can use as a basis. Don't want to use WiFi, Bluetooth, internet or any communication protocol.  Then you won’t be able to track the device. GPS does not allow sending data over the GPS satellite, only recovering position and time data from it.If you need to send the position back to a server (and I am sure that you do), then the following can be used, in increasing order of cost: WiFiPacket data / SMS satellite WiFi : cheap, and free in many places, but you can’t guarantee coverage. Places like Singapore might have almost countrywide coverage of free wifi, but otherwise, I would not expect it, even in big cities like London or New York. In fact, for a security device, you would never want to rely on free wifi.Packet data / SMS : depending on the data/call plans, choose whether it is cheaper to send data as TCP or use a RESTful API. If that seems too expensive, consider using SMS – lots of existing apps do, but many of them do it for legacy reasons and have been doing so for decades. Satellite : is pushing it slightly for “wearable”, but it could be done as a belt, and easily in a small rucksack. It is also your only option (except for some tricky radio stuff, but that it beyond my ken).

Along with the WPS idea that I initially suggested, they have a few other options: Another common approach is to have the coffee maker appear as an access point with its own SSID and pass phrase, which is supplied on the manufacturer's quick start card. In this approach, when the coffee maker is plugged in and powered on the SSID of the coffee maker is broadcast so that it is easily identified. A user disconnects from the wireless network, connects wirelessly and directly to the coffee maker, and navigates to an area to enter the SSID and network pass phrase. The device is then configured as a client on the user's network.This method would seem most practical for any network where you are unable to use WPS (no WPS support from your router, perhaps, or concerns about WPS security). Of course, it is quite involved and would require more technical knowledge, so it's not ideal.All of these methods I've outlined only really work if you're in control of the design of the IoT device - as a consumer, if the device's connection method doesn't work, it's essentially tough luck - the only option is to return it to the store!",298,0,2,0

Disappointingly, this doesn't seem to be the case - the hairbrush still requires you to manually brush your hair, but it does have an awful lot of sensors to take advantage of: The Kérastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings minimizes these risks, taking advantage of multiple sensors that provide information on the quality of hair and brushing patterns. These include:    A microphone that listens to the sound of hair brushing to identify patterns, providing insights into manageability, frizziness, dryness, split ends and breakage.  3-axis load cells that measure the force applied to the hair and the scalp when brushing.  An accelerometer and a gyroscope which help further analyze brushing patterns and count brush strokes, with haptic feedback signaling if brushing is too vigorous. Conductivity sensors to determine if the brush is being used on dry or wet hair in order to provide an accurate hair measurement. The brush itself is splash proof. (from the Press Release you linked)With this information, I think there's a lot of choice for what to use the brush for. New Statesman has a rather nefarious idea for what could be done: Munro hasn’t yet looked at the Hair Coach, but he speculates about the security of any IoT device with a microphone and internet connection. “Listening to hair breakage requires a microphone, so can it hear more than just breaks? It’s clearly very sensitive, so could it detect human voice and potentially become a spy bug?”You could, in theory, take advantage of the hair brush's microphone to act as a sound detector (perhaps for security?), although I doubt the microphone is particularly sensitive - its original purpose only requires it to pick up sounds within a 10 or 20 centimetre radius. Even so, if you put the brush in a key location, the microphone could perhaps detect someone walking past, and you could write some software to push a notification to your phone and inform you.It's hard to know exactly how (or if) this could be done without more information on the product, which we can't know until it's released, but I'm sure if you were inventive enough, you could overwrite whatever code they have installed (unless the device only contains read-only memory, which is a strong possibility).",403,0,2,0

What it does it take some more tractable measurements and user data to provide an estimate based on identified modes of activity (for example -sleeping, jogging, walking). Across a group of individuals, there is potential for significant variation between the observed parameters and actual calorie burn.Where the data can be expected to be more accurate is in comparing relative calorie burn with different days for a specific individual, and the obvious advantage is the trivial instrumentation overhead compared with attempting any precision calorimitry in an open-air activity.Its important to appreciate that the calorie number is an estimate, but when does anyone care about anything precise with calories? Even with blood pressure, the value is being able to identify changes over time in the majority of even medically monitored applications (rather than one-off diagnostic measurements).Some effort does need to be made to formalise the value of herd measurements like this, educate professionals to work with low quality data, and educate users to appreciate this cheap data is not always individually informative.",244,0,0,0

Thus, it has to be short.It has to work with an almost 100% accuracy when called and also not recognized with that certainty when not called for. That makes problems and also makes for a minimum length for wake words. Amazon's choice to allow Echo is quite surprising since it's just two syllables.If we look at the usual suspects, we have Alexa (3 syllables), Amazon (3), Echo (2), Ok Google (4), Hey Cortana (4), and Hey Siri (3). All industry giants almost agree on three being a good choice number of syllables.Strangely enough the most wanted wake word ""computer"" has also three syllables and would match that requirement easily.

764,-1,NA,16686,14,"This article claims that using a blockchain-based security system for an IoT network would prevent some types of attacks: Blockchain technology may help offer an answer. Gada observes that blockchain offers inherent security not present in current, traditional networks. “Blockchain technology is seen as a way to add security and privacy to sensors and devices,” he states. “In traditional IT architectures, tampering can occur if a hacker is able to get through firewalls and other defenses built up by an organization. Once inside, tampering is often not recorded or noticed, and can occur unimpeded. This is simply not possible when using blockchain.”  Blockchain, Gada explains, is “a suitable solution in at least three aspects of IoT, including big data management, security and transparency, as well as facilitation of micro-transactions based on the exchange of services between interconnected smart devices.”This seems like a bold, yet rather vague claim.

Currently, most people use a trusted middleman such as a bank to make a transaction. But blockchain allows consumers and suppliers to connect directly, removing the need for a third party.  Using cryptography to keep exchanges secure, blockchain provides a decentralized database, or “digital ledger”, of transactions that everyone on the network can see. This network is essentially a chain of computers that must all approve an exchange before it can be verified and recorded.  How does it work in practice?  In the case of Bitcoin, blockchain stores the details of every transaction of the digital currency, and the technology stops the same Bitcoin being spent more than once.

766,764,0,NA,8,"Blockchain technology provides a distributed transaction record. New data is appended to the chain and encrypted by multiple parties. The encryption process is compute intensive which makes it relatively hard for the data to be either corrupted or retrospectively modified.The most well known application of the blockchain is in enabling financial transations without having to rely on a network of banks or other trusted parties, although banks are taking an interest in the blockchain and may soon be competing to contribute to contributing the majority of the encryption effort.The most relevant application of the blockchain to IoT technology appears to be in distributing trusted items (keys, firmware, etc). Although the blockchain is hard to subvert, the compute effort required to verify it is also non-trivial. So as a communication mechanism, it has more strength in being able to detect tampering than in being hard to forge.Facilitating micro-transactions certainly enables new functionality, but it is not clear that this scales well to all types of endpoint any more than any other payment technology.",171,0,0,0

Last will (LWT, Last Will and Testament) messages are otoh not a system topic but a regular topic as set up by the client during connect. If you want to monitor that topic simply subscribe to it.

Blockchains are inherently inefficient at processing and storing large amounts of data. All data must be relayed to and processed by every full node, and is stored forever by every archival node. Bitcoin transactions are tiny at about 250 byte a piece, and the Bitcoin blockchain is currently growing at a rate of about one gigabyte per week – it's now 117GB in size. Contrary to popular narrative, blockchains are a terrible solution to most problems that they are hyped to solve.security: Security of what? Blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin are secured by their protocols paying large rewards of native tokens to the validators. The validators in turn provide work by spending irretrievable resources, which would have to be replicated to change the recorded history. This makes their blockchain essentially write-only and immutable. Additionally, the rules make sure that only the owner of assets can reassign them.From the excerpt, it neither becomes clear who would be validating the state of the network, nor what the supposed ""assets"" stored in the database would be or how the convergence and validation of the network would be incentivized.transparency: Agreed, open blockchains are public goods and every participant can be as transparent as they want.micro-transactions: It is very unlikely that micro-transactions will be solved directly on a blockchain. Again, we're talking about a terribly inefficient data structure that requires replication of all information in the network. Bitcoin transactions currently cost about $0.15 a piece. There is a real cost associated to storing every transaction forever on the blockchain. Second layer systems being built on top of blockchains such as Raiden on Ethereum and the Lightning Network on Bitcoin may provide cheaper micro transactions in the future, but even then each payment channel would need to be anchored to the blockchain with a blockchain transaction, so there is a palpable minimum value to be transferred before this becomes cost-effective.I'd like to end with pointing out an article by Gideon Greenspan of MultiChain on Avoiding the pointless blockchain project. It seems to me that the proposed project here infringes on multiple points, e.g.:We already trust the producer with the firmware, why then would we not trust them with updates of it?For the same reason, why would we need multiple arbitrary writers? Aren't we just trusting the producer of the hardware anyway?What sort of interaction is there between transactions?It seems plausible to me that multiple publish-subscribe databases in combination with digital signature cryptography would offer the sought benefits.

Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases 20–30 metres (66–98 ft)I would imagine the lower range would occur in situations where there was not a clear path for the radio transmissions, and perhaps in challenging radio environments. Outside, I would imagine this is less of a problem.So, assuming the above is true: you will be transmitting for 1/30th of an hour, at approximately 100mW during the transmission phase.Hence, per hour, you will consume approximately 0.00333 Wh of energy. For comparison, a 'long-life' alkaline AA battery stores around 2.6 Wh of energy. Therefore, your battery would last about 30 days with Bluetooth 3.0, which isn't really bad, but could be a lot better.These calculations are all very rough, but they should be in the ballpark if the assumptions are correct. EE Times suggests that 5% of the time transmitting is on the high end, and my estimate of 2 seconds / minute is roughly 3.33%.Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) might be more viable; this page suggests 10mW power for a 77m range, which would give a battery life closer to 1 year (325 days, more precisely!). However, this would require new hardware, which is, admittedly, a disadvantage.As I mentioned in a comment, this sort of setup seems perfect for a mesh network, and that should reduce your range requirements significantly, since you won't have to transmit 30 metres to the hub, just 2 or 3 metres to the next beehive. In that case, you could probably get away with a much less powerful radio, which would save battery life.It may be worth considering one of the mesh protocols such as ZigBee or the new BLE Mesh protocol, which would both suit your use-case well.",360,0,4,0

This makes some sense since broadcasters may use in-band signaling to identify adverts (for localised replacement), and the audio processing typically applied to adverts might be optimised for clarity over fidelity. The filtering might be set up so that typical adverts are monitored with reduced sensitivity, and during the production of a specific advert, the senditivity could be explicitly reduced too.A news report (which reportedly did trigger Alexa) would be more likely to use the full broadcast audio spectrum (8 or 16 kHz) without processing.

If you enable voice control of locks, someone could stand outside your house and tell your voice system to unlock the lock.Surprisingly (or perhaps not!), this has already happened with an August Smart Lock controlled by Siri: Last Friday morning, as Marcus was pulling out of the driveway, Mike [Marcus' neighbour] walked up with a grin asking if he could borrow some flour. Marcus responded sure and started to get out of the car to let him in. But before Marcus could do anything, his neighbour said, ""I'll let myself in,"" and ran over to the front door.

Further assuming that the the smart lock itself is secure for the moment we can concentrate on the trigger.Triggering a smart lock with a voice assistantGenerally there are three options to verify that only an authorized person can open the door. Those are called authentication factors, either the person knows something, the person has something or the person is someone. Those can be combined into two-factor, three-factor or even more-factor authentications. The corresponding Wikipedia page is an interesting read about those. The voice assistants currently are unable to discern between voices.That inability excludes possibility three, identifying you being you outside your door. On its own, it's obviously unable to check you for having something specific too. That leaves one authentication factor, you knowing something.Thus, you'll have to configure Google Home or SmartThings or the smart lock to not react to generic commands, but only to specific ones you set. The simplest thing would be renaming your smart lock device. It would leave you for example with the command, Ok, Google, open the hidden kingdom.As with every authentication that is based on knowing something, which is essentially a password, or in this case more aptly a passphrase, the usual rules apply. Change it from the default valueChange it regularlyMake the passphrases hard to guess (and easy to remember)Don't tell anyone unauthorizedSince you literally have to say that passphrase in semi-public with passing neighbors, in front of guests and in easy reach of malicious listeners you'd optimally never use a passphrase twice.This is why I haven't provided any actual configuration possibilities. Without adding another factor to the voice activated smart lock this is just a truly insecure idea.Possible second factors could be a face-recognition camera being activated by voice which verifies your identity and opens the lock or a proximity check for your smart phone.

The methodology I use to evaluate each method should be applicable to any other ciphers you find and wish to compare.AESAES is one of the most popular symmetric-key encryption algorithms (which means you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt). In terms of security, AES is a safe bet: Best public cryptanalysis  Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.  - WikipediaThe paper Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES describes that AES-128 requires 2126.1 operations, AES-192 requires 2189.7 operations, and AES-256 requires 2254.4 operations to break. On a 2.9 GHz processor, assuming each 'operation' is 1 CPU cycle (probably not true), breaking AES-128 would take a very long time. With 10 000 of them running, it will still take nearly forever. So, security isn't a concern here; let's consider the power aspect.This paper shows (on page 15) that encrypting a block with AES used 351 pJ. I'll compare this a little later after talking about some other common algorithms.SIMONI asked a question about SIMON and SPECK previously, which is worth a read. Where SIMON excels is in situations where you need to encrypt a little bit of data, frequently. The paper I linked earlier states that SIMON 64/96 uses 213 pJ for 64 bits, which is practical when you only need to send 32 bits of payload.SIMON 64/96 is significantly easier to break than AES though; the paper I linked suggests a 263.9 operations, so our 10 000 CPU setup could crack the encryption in only a few years, as opposed to millions of millennia.Does it really matter?At the rate you plan to transmit, the answer is almost certainly no; the energy usage from cryptography will be entirely negligible. For AES, you would use 50 544 pJ per day, so a cheap carbon-zinc AA battery with 2340 J of energy would last far beyond the device's lifetime. If you re-evaluate the calculations with SIMON, you find that it also has a very long lifetimeIn short, unless you're transmitting very frequently, the radio is far more of a concern for power. Wikipedia quotes the power usage as between 0.01 and 0.5 W. If you transmit for 1 second at 0.01 W, you've already used more power than AES did over the whole day.For BLE, though, you're probably fine just relying on the default security; BLE uses AES-CCM by default for link-layer security: Encryption in Bluetooth with low energy uses AES-CCM cryptography. Like BR/EDR, the LE Controller will perform the encryption function. This function generates 128-bit encryptedData from a 128-bit key and 128-bit plaintextData using the AES-128-bit block cypher as defined in FIPS-1971.There is some concern that there are security flaws with BLE's implementation of the link-layer security though; this is not a flaw in AES; rather Bluetooth SIG decided to roll their own key exchange mechanism in 4.0 and 4.1.

Listening: When Alexa’s microphone(s) have been activated, she is in a listening state and is waiting for voice input.

So during the day different devices would report different events like:Temperature sensor: New ""highest temperate ever measured"": 30 °C.Connected dog-feeder: The dog food container is empty.Some kind of sensor: This happened while you was away and you should know about.Basically a service would collect all the data from the sensors and would create a report file that could be used with Alexa like:Alexa, read 'Afternoon home report'.Alexa, read 'Morning home report'.(So I could ask Alexa at the end of the day ""What happened today?"" and it could tell me by reading the reports.)ProblemsThe reports should be in a correct format to make them eligible for Alexa to read them.

That phrase seems to start the build-in flash briefing—even though I couldn't find an entry in any documentation confirming it I tested it. You should also check if the read a book function is even available in your geography—for me, here, it's not.Since you already need a system to aggregate a sensor data—otherwise you couldn't generate your report, you can also look into the skill route.

Those can be several and they can be ordered however you like. If you're okay with the report you want to build to be in these information you can consider this skill type.

So your dream utterance is already pre-defined to use this and if you're set on the phrase it's even the only solution.Since the interaction model is pre-defined there is only one Alexa skill page to configure.Then you'd only have to provide an rss-feed with the information as described here in the documentation.

You can switch a load of essentially any size by using the HS-100 to switch a secondary relay (solid state or electromechanical.)Electromechanical relays able to switch many kilowatts are available at prices that are usually well below the cost of the automation system switches. You may need a small amount of extra circuitry depending on the required coil voltage. If you use a relay with a mains-voltage AC coil you need only the relay plus an enclosure and whatever is required for connections. Note that solid state switches (SSRs) are both far more costly than 'old fashioned' relays, and inferior in energy losses. SSR2 typically drop 2 to 3 VAC across the operating relay. At 50A that would dissipate Power = V x I = 2V x 50A = 100 Watts (or 150W at 3V). This level of thermal energy requires heat sinking. A mechanical relay such as the 90A Panasonic one listed below has a contact resistance of under 2 milliOhm worst case at end of lifetime for a energy loss at 50A of I^2 x R = 5 Watts (or 16 Watts at 90A). At 50A switched ~= 5.5 kW load the 5 Watts (or less) dissipation can be accommodated using standard mounting methods. .

881,880,1,11201,13,"A general process of microcontroller selection.Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:1 hardware timer, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.2 GPIO pins to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.Possibly UART to interface the RF communication module.1 ADC input to monitor the battery voltage.You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.Decide the required CPU performance and memory requirements. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance. Probably a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).Low power. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.Developer tools. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.You can choose the ATtiny25 which costs 0.87$/1 piece on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin so won't take much space. In Power-down mode it consumes 0.2 μA with disabled watchdog, at 3 V. 2-4 μA if the watchdog is enabled.It is Arduino compatible so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (Note that: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively low power consumption, the bit-banged UART might complicates it though. It has 2 kB program memory which should be enough for you.Or go with an ARM Cortex M0, which consumes 2 μA in Standby mode and 5 μA in Stop mode. Such MCU is for example STM32F030F4 which costs 1.09$/1 piece. It is a more powerful 32-bit controller with a maximum of 48 MHz system clock frequency, but as you can see only for +0.2$. It comes with 16 kB program memory, far than enough for this simple task. It has SPI, UART, I2C and plenty other peripherals.Programming it will costs more, dedicated programmer costs 20$ at Farnell. In my opinion, not worth it. Instead you can invest in a development board for the F0 family which has an on-board programmer (ST-LINK). STM32F0Discovery board costs ~10$.

Even with network address translation (NAT) and private address space, the IoT’s appetite for addresses will overcome IPv4’s ability to sate it.  Enter IPv6, which expands the address space to 340 undecillion, or 3.4×1038. Well, it’s technically a bit less than that, since some combinations are reserved; nonetheless, that’s still enough usable addresses to allocate about 4,000 to every person on the planet.What puzzles me is why the Internet of Things would make any difference to the need to switch to IPv6. It seems to me that the vast majority of Things are connected to a router, hence a need only for one world-wide IP. For instance, your smart oven's (or whatever) IP is 192.168.0.52, that doesn't prevent your neighbour's Echo from having the same IP, because in order to access that IP from outside your home, you have to go through your home's IP address, ex: 148.238.24.9.Why would the advent of IoT necessitate the switch to IPv6?",197,0,0,0
896,891,0,NA,9,"The Onion Omega 2 claims to be the smallest Linux computer in the world. That claim may not quite be true (see the vocore2 below, for example) but in my experience it's got to be in the smallest 3. Costs only $5, built-in wifi, designed with IoT specifically in mind. Has a few shields available on their web site. Brand new product, seems to have a strong and active community. Kickstarter backers get the device. Worth checking out. Also, as pointed out in comments, check out the vocore2, which actually seems to be smaller than the Onion, and cheaper at $4. It's currently being funded at IndieGoGo and estimated shipping dates are February 2017 (next month at the time of this writing). Also looks to have an assortment of docks available, and has a built-in wifi router, which is kinda cool.I just came across those the other day and have no experience with them. Note, however, due to their newness, some of the Linux packages you may be used to using may not be available yet (for example, I know for a fact that at the time of this writing a gstreamer package is not available on the Onion yet, you have to build from source, although gstreamer is not relevant for you).Short of those, like the other answer says, the Pi is a great low cost device. Don't forget the Raspberry Pi Zero, another tiny $5 computer along the lines of the Onion. It doesn't have all the ports on board that the larger Pi's have but if you don't mind, or if you just want to use a 3 for development and a Zero for its size in final products, it's another choice worth considering.Other devices, some expensive, include:BeagleBone Black (this is the only Pi alternative I'd seriously consider because of its low cost).Gumstix ($$$, but we use these all the time in projects for their size)Udoo ($$$ but packs a punch)Toradex Colibri (A bit hard to work with but we use these a lot, too, better specs than a Gumstix, and have the option of running Windows CE with an instant boot feature if you'd prefer a Windows toolchain and virtually zero boot time).Also note that Vilros makes some awesome Pi starter kits (cheaper on Amazon) pre-packaged with an OS, working Wifi, heat sinks, a case, works right out of the box and saves a ton of grunt setup work. Also worth checking out if you go the Pi route. Vilros also used to make Beaglebone starter kits, which no longer seem to be available on their site but if you search Newegg/Amazon/etc. you can still find available stock.By the way, an Arduino (or another microcontroller, contrast with the full-blown single-board computers listed above) on its own probably isn't what you want here. The Arduino is just an Atmel ATmega168/328. It does not run an OS and doesn't really do anything besides precisely what you tell it to do. So for example, for networking you'd need the ethernet shield, which ships with a full ethernet control library that I believe provides a TCP and UDP stack (I've never used it, just browsing their site) and of course takes up a lot of limited code space. Then you'd have to build your weather client and everything on top of that, and you've got to do it all in 32KB or less. It's a different flavor of development than doing Linux/Windows development on the Pi/Beaglebone/Gumstix/Colibri/etc. A bit outside the scope of this answer.What the Arduino is good for here is as an add-on to your main system to do hardware interface stuff, like read pressure sensors, buttons, control basic electronic elements, that kind of thing. Embedded systems development is a whole different beast than the desktop development you'd be doing on the Pi, and I really wouldn't recommend trying to do this with an Arduino alone, especially without experience.",649,0,3,0
897,894,0,NA,11,"IPv6 is a necessity now; we're nearly out of IPv4 addresses already. As more and more people come online, we're starting to reach the point where IPs have to be shared across multiple people, not just one household (carrier-grade NAT), which is unacceptable, and not just a problem for IoT.IPv6 allows us to move to a more semantic representation where one IP = one device, which has several advantages. If you're directly able to address your smart device (be it a toaster, oven, light bulb, TV, or something else), you can just send your commands directly to the device, rather than needing to go through a hub. At the moment, NAT makes this difficult to set up, because it requires specifically port forwarding your IoT devices (and this may not work at all for carrier-grade NAT).It might be worth reading 'Switching to IPv6 implies dropping NAT. Is that a good thing?' from Server Fault if you're worried about the security implication; having all your IoT devices given a public IPv6 address is not really a big security flaw; it's something that would still cause a problem on a NAT-enabled network.This IEEE article has some good points: The next logical step from networks of mobile devices to networks of communicating ""Things"" is IoT. That next step will mirror the sequence of events experienced by mobile networks. Proprietary protocols came first, because an individual company’s profits often come before consideration of the common good. But the use of IP and transparency (i.e., open source protocols) is fundamental to IoT development, just as the ease of use and the invisibility of the technology is important to end users. Our view, based on our research, is that the value of transparency and ease-of-use, and even more importantly the need for interoperability, will favor IPv6 adoption by the IoT market.So, in short:At the moment, 1 IPv4 address represents... who knows? Sometimes a device, sometimes a router, sometimes a whole network of different customers.Using an IPv6 lets you give each IoT device a 'name' on the Internet.Being able to address your devices lets you control them, and simplifies setup and management.",354,0,2,0
898,891,0,NA,6,"I suggest a step by step approach to find out what language and controller you should use. The microcontroller you need will depend on the tasks you want it to do. Theoretically the task will set up some requirements that an appropriate microcontroller will fulfill, so you should choose the microcontroller by these requirements.Define a user story for the device. What do you expect from it? What do you want it to be capable of?In your case it is already defined by you: A battery powered device that should be capable of receiving inputs from a smart-phone and display weather information of requested locations on its own display.Now step 1. gives you something to start with. You can decide what hardware you need on a block diagram level. You will certainly need a display and possibly a WiFi or Bluetooth module to communicate with your mobile. Accessing global weather databases will possibly require Internet connection. You should control both of these with an MCU or the WiFi module (you need Internet so you can exclude Bluetooth) should be able to control the display and run your software.You can start looking for specific parts. You can start with deciding what battery you will use, so you can take into consideration the power consumption of your potential parts. I have summed a general process for selecting MCUs in one of my previous answer. Basically the same should be done here. Find a cheap display, it will probably use an SPI or I2C interface for communication. Then you can search for either a Wifi module with SPI/I2C and has an integrated MCU or a separate MCU and a WiFi module. The individual WiFi module will probably use UART to communicate so the individual MCU should have that along the SPI/I2C.As for the language. Most microcontroller will limit your possibilities in this field. In most cases your choices will be either C, C++ or Assembly, strictly speaking of microcontrollers here and not single board computers.If you decide to go with a BeagleBone or Raspberry which can run Linux or other powerful OS then I say that the best language will be the one that you know the best, of course it should be able to handle the task. (You can run Java on the RPi if you like.)Opening a socket to a global weather data service can be done in C, C# or Python as well. Would be a bit more difficult to process JSON with C but certainly possible.Speaking about costs in general. The best option is to search for WiFi enabled display devices, there will be a lot of results and most of them will use the same hardware, and probably this will be the cheapest.You could use an ESP8266 WiFi module which is Arduino compatible to connect to the internet and interface a display. It will require much tinkering than a Raspberry Pi would but will be cheaper.Here is a Hackaday project about ESP8266 + OLED display.",495,0,2,0
900,894,1,19009,16,"There are two reasons. (1) First is simpler, end-to-end connectivity. If both source and destination have public IPv4 (or IPv6, of course) address, they can connect to each other in any direction anytime.Your IoT with private IP 192.168.0.52 however can use NAT ONLY to connect to any public IP on the Internet whenever it wants, but the rest of the Internet cannot connect to it. There were kludges like DNAT and uPNP that used to allow you to specify that some incoming connections are enabled, but they are breaking more and more nowadays due to implementation of CGNAT because of IPv4 shortages.A common (so-called) ""solution"" to this problem is that all your (NATed) devices connect to some central location with public IP (usually hosted by the manufacturer of device). This makes it work technically, but involves a privacy issue (you're giving all the data from your IoTs), security issue (as you're wide open to them, breach or disgruntled employee can do anything your IoT device can do and access), and reliability issue (when the manufacturer goes out of business or decides to stop supporting old devices or is suffering outages) all your (and everybody elses) perfectly functional devices will stop working.(2) second problem is that it will stop working anyway (even for outgoing connections) some time in the future (not in a year or two, but still. The more IoT and services catch on, the sooner it will start breaking).That is because NAT allows private addresses like 192.168.0.52 to reach the Internet at large. It does that by changing source address 192.168.0.52 to public IP of your router, but replaces source port with free one from the pool. For example, your first connection might be 192.168.0.52:1000 might be (CG)-NATed to (public IP) 198.51.100.1:1000, and your neighbour 192.168.0.77:1000 might get NATed to 198.51.100.1:1001. Your second connection from 192.168.0.52:1001 would then be NATed to 198.51.100.1:1002 etc.Problem is, even simple stuff like opening a web page will likely open dozens of connections and use a dozen of ports (for DNS queries, HTTP(S) connection for different elements, JS analytics on different sites etc). More expensive programs, like torrent clients, will easily use up a thousands of ports. And there is only 65535 ports available for any IP.Which means several of your neighbours sharing the same CGNAT IP use a bigger share of connections (and more IoTs will mean more connections), and suddenly all of 65535 ports on that public IP 198.51.100.1 are used. Which means no new connections can be established for you and your neighbours. Which on bigger scale means lots people are cut from their IoTs, and civilisation as we know it collapses :-)Since we would like to delay this civilisation collapse as long as possible, we're transitioning to IPv6 instead. Please support continued existence of this civilisation by using IPv6 if possible. Thanks!",471,0,1,0

Security is hard, and implementation of it usually vastly increases codebase, and with it number of bugs (and thus possible attack vectors / exploit opportunities). IoTs rarely get firmware upgrades, so when a IoT device without auto-update has a problem, it is almost guaranteed to provide Botnets with extra zombie machines.And yes, auto-upgrade itself is not without issues - from privacy issues to possibility that evildoers will take control of it if not implemented properly; but it should be lower risk than hoping your first firmware will be without any security bugs allowing attackers to increase their zombie ranks.",209,0,0,0

If you're not familiar with how SYN scans work, they essentially involve sending a TCP SYN packet, which is the normal process of starting a TCP connection. The attacker then waits in hope of receiving a SYN-ACK packet, which would confirm that the target is listening on the specified port. You can read more about the process on Wikipedia.Any targets that respond with a SYN-ACK are added to a list of potential victims.Mirai selects a password to try semi-randomly, using some sort of weighting system and attempts to connect using that.Mirai then monitors to check if its connection was successfulIf the connection times out or something goes wrong, Mirai retries for a maximum of 10 attempts.If all of this succeeds, tough luck. Your device is now infected until it restarts!So, in summary, to answer your question, yes, the version of Mirai known publicly will be defeated if you change the username and password.

There are established links between each node via router nodes.If Node A wants to send a message to Node Z for the first time then Node A must perform a Route Discovery to determine which intermediate nodes will forward its message.The Route Discovery mechanism is described here. According to it the route with the lowest cost will be stored in a Routing Tables of the nodes.So far everything is fine, every node knows what to do, they can reach each other.Now, an intermediate node, between Node A and Node B breaks down, so the currently stored route becomes unusable.What happens in this case? I imagine that when Node A wants to send a message, it will travel all the way to the broken link where it will get stuck. The last node in the route will send back a message about the failure which will trigger a new Route Discovery by Node A, then a new route will be found and everything will alright again.It is generally fine (given I was correct); the network recovers. But I am wondering if there are any algorithms or methods that provide a network monitoring feature which continuously checks the state of the links presented in the Routing Tables. So Node A can be notified about the failure before it wants to send another message to Node Z, and instead of running into a dead end, it can start with a Route Discovery at once. So basically what I'm thinking of is a service which periodically checks the links.I understand that as ZigBee is usually used on battery powered, low-power devices such a mechanism would be not energy efficient.So in general what are now the most effective link failure detecting mechanisms that can be used in a low-power, wireless sensor network, especially in a ZigBee mesh network?",312,0,1,0
929,928,1,3470,2,"From what I've found, it seems that some implementations (e.g. TI's Z-STACK) recommend refreshing the routing table every so often to avoid 'dead' nodes: Yes, I waited 5 to 10 minutes. What is ""some time""? I have seen cases where it takes a few minutes to recover. For example, if I cycle power on the gateway, it takes maybe a minute or two for the closest nodes to connect, then another minute or two for each successive level. But I waited much longer than this for the mesh to recover from this routing change.    Yes, it might takes up to many minutes. So, if you want 5 or minutes, will your device come back? It is recommend to call NLME_RouteDiscoveryRequest() periodically to maintain the routing table.You can read more about what NLME_RouteDiscoveryRequest() does in the developer guide (see page 11/12): The following figure shows an example of the many-to-one route discovery procedure. To initiate many-to-one route discovery, the concentrator broadcast a many-to-one route request to the entire network. Upon receipt of the route request, every device adds a route table entry for the concentrator and stores the one hop neighbor that relays the request as the next hop address. No route reply will be generated.  Many-to-one route request command is similar to unicast route request command with same command ID and payload frame format. The option field in route request is many-to-one and the destination address is 0xFFFC. The following Z-Stack API can be used for the concentrator to send out many-to-one route request. Please refer to the ZStack API documentation for detailed usage about this API.  ZStatus_t NLME_RouteDiscoveryRequest( uint16 DstAddress, byte options, uint8 radius )Fault Tolerance in ZigBee Wireless Sensor Networks is an interesting paper with some more information about how ZigBee networks tolerate node failure. It appears that the implementation used there reconstructed the network when one of the nodes was removed (the exact method of this is not clear, unfortunately), so that the malfunctioning node is no longer included in the mesh. In some cases, this led to sensors becoming 'orphaned' before requesting to rejoin the mesh network via a different route.In summary, from the resources I've found: it depends on your implementation, but most will re-evaluate the routing table reasonably frequently to avoid broken nodes from harming the network. I suspect you'll be able to get a more accurate response if you ask the vendor of your specific ZigBee implementation, since the exact operation will vary.",414,0,2,0

946,608,0,NA,5,"To understand better the power consumption of smart plugs it's worth peeking into them. To do so let's see some smart plug reference designs.One from AtmelOne from Texas InstrumentsAs you can see the parts of these two different designs are quite the same.There is an AC/DC power supply which provides the DC voltage for the sub-circuits.There is a ""brain"", a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller unit. The ATSAMW25 and the CC3200.There are some dedicated hardware for power measurement.A relay to be able to switch the mains lines.Some feedback LED and buttons to interface the plug locally.Basically the power consumption of the plug itself is the total power consumption of these parts. The main consumers are the Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers, the relays and I believe that the LEDs consume more than the metering parts. On the top of these comes the efficiency of the AC/DC power supply, there will be a certain amount of power loss on these elements.Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollerMost of the time the application processor will be in low-power mode with a current consumption between μA and mA. The Wi-Fi will add some more consumption, a couple of mA in its idle state.The CC3200 for example consumes 12 mA if the application MCU is in Sleep mode (not deep sleep) and the Network Processor is in idle connected state. In case of RX the consumption rises to 56 mA and in case of TX to 270 mA maximum. (Detailed tables on page 32.)Of course these parameters can vary for different devices from different manufacturers but roughly the scale is the same.RelaysThere can be significant losses depending on the relay type. There is loss because of the coil, called coil power. This can be even hundreds of mW (10A, 240 VAC relay 500 - 700 mW coil power, cheapest on Farnell).And there is loss because of the contact resistance (100 mΩ for the previous relay, and with a 10 A load it dissipates some power). More expensive ones have better parameters, there are ones with 50 mΩ resistance for example.I am sure that the low cost knockoff plugs have cheaper relays so possibly consumes somewhat more.LEDsWorth noting the couple of mA, but nothing more.AC/DC power supplyThis will add a percentage on the top of the overall consumption. Cheaper converters probably have lower efficiency, so a cheap plug would consume more in this case too.The UCC28910 700V Flyback Switcher from TI's design has a typical of 75% efficiency according to the datasheet (page 30.). There can be worse ones and few better. Again it gives a rough scale.All of these can vary of course but mainly these are the factors that determine the consumption of the device itself.You could calculate a worst-case consumption for TI's design to get a W value.

954,950,0,NA,4,"A security camera would be the obvious example. if you want to do motion detection on the image (or face recognition), you have the choice of either streaming the video feed to the cloud, or processing it locally. This sort of application will probably be marginal for upstream bandwidth on a lot of domestic internet connections today - that gives more incentive to perform either processing or at least compression on the edge. The audio decoding of a smart home hub is another example. Certainly, the wake-word detection makes sense to perform at the hub (if only for privacy). Once the edge node has the processing capability required for voice control, maybe it makes sense to push that processing to the edge. For the service provider, this is a free gain - the node already needs a low-end linux capable platform, so why not make use of this resource rather than providing bandwidth and CPU in the cloud. Significantly, the bandwidth is likely to cost as much as the CPU in this context.Even if the bandwidth load is reduced, an application may still be able to use edge computing and save cloud resource by making use of compute power which already exists in the edge node.

957,950,1,76519,6,"Remember, you are always processing data at the edge, even if it's not obvious. The choice to sample data at a particular frequency, whether that is 1Hz or 100Khz (particularly with analogue data), is a form of edge processing. Very few scenarios will transmit data at the maximum clock cycle of the processor.Some scenarios where explicit edge processing is usefulBandwidth constraints. The often-quoted example is in the oil and gas industry where a lot of telemetry is gathered, and the bandwidth from the remote location is limited.Low latency requirement. Especially in control systems where something needs to happen in response to data. When sub-second responses mean the difference between normal operation and failure, a second or two round-trip to the cloud is unacceptable.Extremely low value of data. If nothing is likely to be gained from recording data, even in the future with sophisticated analytics, you might as well summarise and drop it at the edge. For example, mains power in the EU is expressed as 'nominally 230 V ±10% at 50Hz'. Given that you can handle that range, there is no point in transmitting the precise voltage every 100ms. If is better to transmit 'from this time to this time, the voltage was nominal'.Ordering of events is important. Devices have a narrower scope and can perform some derivations easier than the cloud. One of these is where the derivation requires that the data is in order. For example, it is easy on a device when measuring, say voltage, when it enters the on or off state. Timestamping the voltage measurement and sending it to the cloud makes the derivation harder as data may come out of order, delayed or be completely lost.As a failure mode. Connectivity to the cloud, or at least some of the processing, is likely to fail. All systems should be able to perform some edge-processing, even if it is dumbed-down, as a failure mode.Non-IP mesh The cloud will only be accessible via a gateway for non-IP devices, such as those that communicate over a low-power network or CAN bus-type wired connection. It may be preferable for devices communicate directly with each other in a 'mesh', in which case IP connectivity isn't needed, never mind cloud connectivity. Mesh is the holy grail of edge computing, but difficult to do.Privacy, trust, and regulatory issues Data can be collected that may be useful and valuable for analytics, but getting customer consent to collection and storage of the data may be difficult, and the cost and risk associated with managing access to the data may be too high. Facial recognition, and most image processing, is the obvious example. Another example is that all modern vehicles have GPS and connectivity built-in for emergency call response. Vehicle manufacturers and dealers could derive valuable insights from a stream of GPS data, but location data is personally identifiable in this scenario and shouldn't be collected, transmitted, processed and stored.Security We are aware that IoT is currently suffering from security issues. While it is possible to create a secure environment with cloud-connected devices, security is a major issue that needs to be actively worked on. Highly secure gateways, edge-based threat detection and other as-yet unknown defense mechanisms are going to be necessary in most environments.When considering material about edge processing, remember to consider the source. Existing IT vendors that haven't cracked the cloud market (IBM, HP, Cisco) are worried that IoT, as the next big thing, bypasses them altogether. As a result they will aggressively market edge processing. Indeed, 'fog computing' is a term created by Cisco to have a 'cloud' closer to the ground (or something). Obviously cloud vendors are marketing the reverse, for their own bottom line.",613,0,0,0

959,958,0,NA,6,"Generally, you need a smart hub when some of your devices don't use Wi-Fi and can't communicate with your home network directly. Quite a lot of devices, especially sensors and actuators (like door locks and motors), use other protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth and Thread, so they can't 'speak' directly with your Wi-Fi router. The hub acts as a translator, being able to communicate with both Wi-Fi networks and other protocols (almost always ZigBee and Z-Wave, but sometimes others too).What's the difference between Wi-Fi and these other protocols?Wi-Fi works well for applications where you're transmitting a lot of data, throughout your house. For example, if you're streaming a video across your house, you'll have no problems at all using Wi-Fi. But, as explained by Time, Wi-Fi isn't perfect for every use case: ""Wi-Fi is a whole-home network,” says Chris Coley, principle engineer and architect with Logitech. Primarily used for media streaming, browsing the web, and other data-heavy activities, it’s a high-bandwidth network that’s power-intensive — just watch how fast your laptop battery dies when you’re watching a video on Netflix.   Many smart home products eschew Wi-Fi-connectivity because it would require their devices to have a dedicated power source or a long-lasting battery.It'd be very costly if every networked device in your home used Wi-Fi, and your shiny new LED bulbs might use even more power than old, incandescent light bulbs, so devices like this turn to other protocols, such as ZigBee or Z-Wave. Philips Hue bulbs, for example, use ZigBee, which is why the bridge is needed to 'translate' back to Wi-Fi so all the other devices can interface with it.You can see how ZigBee and Bluetooth compare on page 51 of A Comparative Study of Wireless Protocols: Bluetooth, UWB, ZigBee, and Wi-Fi; in Figure 6, you can see that Wi-Fi consumes far less power per megabit. So, why don't we use Wi-Fi for everything? If you look at Figure 5, you can see that each Wi-Fi transmission uses far more power than ZigBee (Wi-Fi uses about 700mW, compared to ZigBee's power usage of less than 100mW).For your light bulb, or thermostat, Wi-Fi doesn't make a lot of sense. If your device is just sending a few bytes worth of data (e.g. just a number), why waste loads of power on each transmission?In short: Wi-Fi makes sense when you're sending large amounts of data across long distances. Your devices probably don't need to do that, so other protocols make far more sense.What else do the hubs do?Some hubs, like SmartThings, can run pre-programmed routines ('automations') and allow you to customise their behaviour. Often, devices provide IDEs or editors so that you can customise the rules. You might be able to integrate with IFTTT with some hubs (particularly Wink and SmartThings), which might be the simplest way of linking services together if you're not able to program using your hubs.Do I really need a hub?This really depends on your personal setup. If all of your devices use Wi-Fi, then no, it's probably not necessary. One FAQ on Reddit has a concise explanation: A close parallel can be drawn between a hub and a standard Wi-Fi router. In simple terms, both are boxes with radios and a little bit of smartness. Eventually, hubs and Wi-Fi routers may merge into one product (indeed, the Almond line of routers from Securify already do this), but currently most households will need to buy a hub because no other device in the house has the requisite radios to talk to the various switches and sensors. In addition, the hub must remain in the house so that automation can continue even when no person is there. This allows for presence simulation in “vacation mode” or pre-heating or pre-cooling the house before arrival.In effect: lots of hubs don't just 'translate', they can also perform some processing and automate things that the manufacturer didn't provide by default. If you want the flexibility of customising how your devices work and interact, a hub is a great idea. If you're just planning to have a voice assistant (like a Google Home or Amazon Echo) and want to fetch the weather, there's probably no need just yet.To figure out which hub you should pick, consider the following points:Which protocols do your devices use?You should be able to search for hubs which are compatible with a specific protocol. For example, when I searched for ""Z-Wave hubs"", I found this list of products, so you can get some additional guidance.Do your devices list specific integrations with a hub?For example, the ecobee3 specifically lists SmartThings and Wink as compatible; you should factor this into your decision.Does the hub you're looking at allow you to automate things simply?Some hubs may use a programming language you're unfamiliar with. It's probably best to avoid them, otherwise you're stuck with a device you can't control! So, if that was all too much to read:Bridges generally just 'translate' from one protocol to another, and tend to only work with one device or manufacturer (e.g. the Hue bridge).Hubs can both translate and run automation routines themselves, allowing your devices to interact in a more complex way.For anything more complex than a trivial setup, you probably need a hub. Make sure you research to find out which one suits you!",880,0,4,0

Vendors of chipsets will promote their chosen radio network, vendors of products will promote their management tools, and others will position themselves as the one hub to rule them all. People, and minnow tech companies, fed up with this try and promote standards, which often get co-opted by major players. You will see this where every 'standard' has an 'alliance' page, which is the source of their ability to produce a standard. There is no single 'hub', as there is no single vendor. People need to commit to an ecosystem (or two) and hope for the best. In much the same way that people will commit to the Apple or Android mobile ecosystem, they will commit to a 'smart home' ecosystem. Samsung wants to be the 'Apple of IoT', so does Philips, so do many others.While there are efforts to standardise, because of the frustrations that you are questioning, it is unlikely that any standard will emerge soon, and even more unlikely that it will be a truly open standard.This answer may seem cynical, and more opinion than fact, but IoT is a new market with huge rewards for vendors that dominate.

968,966,1,13298,4,"Goufalite is entirely correct about this problem: it's not a technical issue at all, just a naming problem, so a lot of the advice is very opinionated based on the author's idea of what names are best.The MQTT 3.1 specification says:  Topic Names and Topic Filters are case sensitive Topic Names and Topic Filters can include the space character Topic Names and Topic Filters are UTF-8 encoded strings, they MUST NOT encode to more than 65535 bytes So, purely speaking on technical grounds, the ASCII-only and 'no spaces' rules are not necessary; all compliant MQTT brokers should be able to handle them just fine.I don't really agree with some of the points HiveMQ make anyway: A space is the natural enemy of each programmer, they often make it much harder to read and debug topics, when things are not going the way, they should be. So similar to the first one, only because something is allowed doesn’t mean it should be used. UTF-8 knows many different white space types, it’s pretty obvious that such uncommon characters should be avoided.It's highly unlikely you're going to be using spaces any other way than just pressing the SPACE key on your keyboard, so I don't think accidental usage of homoglyphs is really going to be a problem. Using non-ASCII UTF-8 character makes it really hard to find typos or issues related to the character set, because often they can not be displayed correctly. Unless it is really necessary we recommend avoid using non ASCII character in a topic.Fair point - typing non-ASCII characters can be a big problem. Personally, I would avoid Garage_Sensor_001/Temperature/°C simply because a lot of keyboards don't have a degrees symbol built-in (British keyboards certainly don't!).

973,971,0,NA,10,"This is a very broad question, but I will try to give a few general pointers, hopefully useful to others, as well as you (so, please accept my apologies if I post things which you already know).If you are asking about reading sensors, this is telemetry and not necessarily IoT. I have coded many projects where a standalone PC reads &amp; displays some measurement.If you also want to controller the attached hardware, this is SCADA. Again, it need not necessarily be connected to the internet.Here's a diagram of SCADA, whcih gives avery good feel for the IoT in general. Note that the PLCs on the diagram are sensors and controls of IoT enabled devices.You can ask for hardware commendations for sensors &amp; controller at Hardware Recommendations.And, once you have some code, you can get advice for problems at Stack Overflow.Generally, IoT for industry involves the client/server model, with the client measuring/controlling hardware devices and reporting to/receiving commands from the server. The server also generally has a database, and allows for generation of reports for management and alarms (and may instruct the remote hardware to reconfigure/shutdown based on data received).Phew! That’s the intro out of the way. Now to get our hands dirty.If you want to get into the nitty gritty of coding, look at sockets, and understand the difference between TCP and UDP.Fortunately, the decades have wrapped most of the trickier stuff in libraries, and you are probably best advised to read up on RESTful services. There are numerous free online tutorials, courses and videos, depending on your language; C is a traditional embedded language, with some using C++, but of course, use whatever you know/feel comfortable with. Python is hugely popular and simple to learn, as well as being the recommended language for the Raspberry Pi. Personally, I prefer compiled languages to interpreted, as it is easier to get the bugs out, but the choice is entirely up to you. Just make sure that it has good support for accessing peripherals over USB, Ethernet and - still extremely common in industry – serial port.For the server side, 90%+ of the world’s server are still running on PHP. However, there is an uptake on use of NodeJS, mainly from people who code browser apps, which currently can only be done in JavaScript and don’t want to learn two languages. I don’t recommend developing browser based IoT apps, because of the restrictions on browser code accessing the file system and peripherals (although, I would mention the likes of Cordova, if you want to develop for smartphone).To get started, I would recommend a Raspberry Pi (coding in Python or C).And I * highly* recommend a sensor hat. This one is just an example, but it is not expensive and contains Gyroscope – angular rate sensor: +/-245/500/2000dps Accelerometer Linear acceleration sensor: +/-2/4/8/16 g Magnetometer - Magnetic Sensor: +/- 4/8/12/16 Gauss Barometer: 260 – 1260 hPa absolute range (accuracy depends on the temperature and pressure, +/- 0.1 hPa under normal conditions) Temperature sensor (Temperature accurate to +/- 2 degC in the 0-65 degC range) Relative Humidity sensor (accurate to +/- 4.5% in the 20-80%rH range, accurate to +/- 0.5 degC in 15-40 degC range) 8x8 RGB LED matrix display Small 5 button joystickThat will allow you gather some data and report it to your server. You might be able to find a free service online to receive and display your data. I have seen some on other S.O site, but forget where.But, you probably want to code your won server. I would recommend PHP as programming language. For Linux, you are well provided with LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql &amp; PHP). For Windows, you have to install a WAMP (Windows … etc). You can take your pick. I have used XAMPP in industrial applications for over a decade. You don’t have to use Mysql, Sqlite can serve just as well (shaless plug for my own S.O question of 6 years ago, “Sqlite or MySql? How to decide?“). You will also have to learn about CRUD.Based on the data received from the client/sensor, you might want to send a command back, even just a simple (display : ""temperature too high"", which might translate to closing a valve in an industrial system).You might want to raise alarms in real time (send email saying that the temperature is too high).And, you might also want to think about generating reports. Start with a table showing data received. The consider a chart, or something fancier. Add an option to export to Comma Separated Values (CSV) which allows the end user to import the data into a spreadsheet for further analysis and manipulation.If you do decide that you want fancy reporting, you can do it in PHP, but, after a few decades of that I have now moved to doing much of the report stuff client side, in the browser. For generally principles, get an overview of Single Page Applications and AJAX. I, personally, did a lot of research and chose Google’s AngularJS as my programming language (there are lots of tutorials &amp; great support), but you are free to use plain JS, Jquery, etc, as you please. If you do decide to code browser stuff too, and you might be as well to use NodeJs on the server side, so that you only have to learn one new programing language.Too many choices?

What you probably don't have is an understanding of basic electronics and the art of getting code from your desktop running on a small device.Jumping in at the wrong level of complexity can be daunting, and may mean that you give up too soon. For example, people recommend the ESP8266 and NodeMCU without thinking that you need to get the right one, you need the chip mounted on a development board, you have to get your software on it, you need to wire it up to something, and only then are you able to run JavaScript. That is a lot of different skills that you need, and you could give up on any one of those stages.My recommendation is to start with an Arduino. Where Arduino made a difference in the maker community was how easy it is to plug an Arduino in a USB port, and the compile, build, deploy chain is all sorted for you. You can write some code, and flash some LEDs very quickly.I also suggest that you start with the official Arduino starter kit. While it is very simple, the instructions are easy and you get a bunch of useful electronic bits and pieces (breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, etc) that remain useful.Don't be put off by how basic the Arduino is. Get some enthusiasm going first for the electronics and hands-on part before trying anything too complex. If you find the electronics interesting and want to do more, stick with the Arduino and get a more complex kit. I bought the BOE Shield-Bot robot. It may not be the best or cheapest robot, but has a really good tutorial that goes into detail on how to controls servos and such. You also land up with a whole lot more useful bits.If you get through that, you'll either give up and get back to server-side software, or you will buy more bits, soldering irons, more boards and components. Very soon you'll land up with a drawer of broken dreams like the rest of us.I wouldn't recommend using the Pi too soon. It's more of a computer than a thing, and doesn't have important features that are necessary in the beginning of your journey of understanding (like analogue input).

Furthermore, I ran into a few articles like this one from SlashGear.com, which examines ABI's claims.These articles point out that ABI has yet to explain why they feel that the current ought to drop when the camera is off. We tend to think of it something like a DVD machine or TV screen that turns on in response to Infra Red, but in reality, the Nest Cam functions nothing like the same.A TV only needs to have a small portion of its system booted up. However, the Cam must have the whole system booted up, so as to be able to receive information over the network (drawing electricity) and start the camera as quickly as possible (which is estimated to take 45-60 seconds from cold boot).The current staying at 340mA is not unusual: the camera must keep itself booted up and listening to the router. And according to their spokesman: When Nest Cam is turned off from the user interface (UI), it does not fully power down, as we expect the camera to be turned on again at any point in time. With that said, when Nest Cam is turned off, it completely stops transmitting video to the cloud, meaning it no longer observes its surroundings.So the answer is, no, as far as we can tell, the Nest Cam is not recording you when it's off.",337,0,0,0

998,993,0,NA,5," Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine (M2M) communications   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_thingsIoT devices go beyond inter-device communication. Take for example a TV remote, it is an embedded device which communicates with the TV through an infrared signal to instruct the TV to do something like change channels. Would you consider this an IoT device?IoT devices 'go beyond' by: Allowing more automation in the home.Collecting, storing and aggregating large amounts of data into information that is useful to the user and easy to understand.Allowing users to access information and control devices from inside the home, and even from the outside via the internet.These features could be fully implemented in your product and without cloud services, it's more a case of deciding if the features you want your IoT product to have would benefit from cloud infrastructure. The benefits come in different areas:DataData can be kept on the cloud instead of including a storage media on device. This has many benefits:Cost effective - Pay only for the storage needed, on device storage will add a fixed cost per device and 100% utilisation is unlikely.Flexible - Storage can be increased when needed. On device storage is fixed and will limit the amount of data a device can hold. You could create a device that lets the user provide a storage media like an SD card, this however adds another decision the customer has to make about what card to purchase for their needs and this complexity may deter some customers from buying the product.Redundancy - Cloud storage is typically sold with redundancy measures included, meaning that data is backed up and is very unlikely to be lost.Centralised - If your IoT device is one which customers may buy multiple of, data can be brought together on the cloud to provide a more uniform experience.Access to data - If the data is retained on a cloud service, you as the product provider can access that data. This is useful to see how consumers use your product and can shape improvements in your products. Software ServicesIt's likely that your IoT devices will have an aspect of interaction with the user through software. By utilising the cloud your products software could benefit from:Automatic updates - If you are continually developing new features for your product, using the cloud can ease the distribution of firmware updates. Devices could query the cloud for updates automatically, taking this task away from the user. This could be especially useful if you discover a security issue with your product, being able to push an patch to all existing devices will avoid the issue of some customers not updating their devices manually. Preventing your devices from being hacked and used for malicious purposes will prevent you from receiving bad publicity.Web technology - Web applications are built on the idea that users may access the application from a different range of devices, all with differing operating systems and screen resolutions. As web apps are accessed through internet browsers the user doesn't need to install software on their own devices, users can simply go to a link and login to access their IoT interface. Customers can receive new features in their software interface without having to go through the task to update the software on each of their devices. Hosting this interface online also reduces the hardware requirements of the device and thus unit cost.Features - Some cloud services could be implemented in your product to enhance its features, for example Amazon Lex is available as a cloud service which can be used to enable a user to use voice commands to interact with your device.

Instead, out-of-home requests need to be proxied through a server reached by outbound connections from both the phone and the IoT device.If the user is at home, but their phone is presently on a mobile network rather than their home network, then the above issue still applies. Asking the user to switch their phone from mobile to wifi may or may not be acceptable to different users and depends to some degree on their phone's wifi battery usage; also some phones choose between both dynamically in a way that may be problematic if you require the wifi network.Connection between the phone and device by some other method like BTLE can be an advantage, but is range limited so may not work in all parts of the home or surrounding property, and obviously will not work when away from home.So while you can build a device that doesn't require the support of out-of-home server infrastructure, it's probably better to build a device that can make effect use of a relay server, if reachable or allowed by user preference settings.

1008,1006,0,NA,8,"A little bit of contextSince you're using MQTT with AWS IoT, you're expected to use X.509 certificates for authentication and security. Amazon have a little bit of guidance about how you should secure your certificates, so I'll quote that here: Certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices. This means you can burn private keys into secure storage on a device without ever allowing the sensitive cryptographic material to leave the device.Since you're currently using the STM32's Read Out Protection (RDP), all but the most determined attackers will have trouble accessing your certificates in your current scheme: The global Read Out Protection allows the embedded firmware code (preloaded in the Flash memory) to protect against reverse engineering, dumping using debug tools or other means of intrusive attack.   Level 0 - No protection (default) Level 1 - Flash memory is protected against reading by debugging or code dumping by the RAM loaded code Level 2 - All debug features are disabled Is external storage going to be secure?It probably isn't as secure. If your client's private key is stolen, an attacker can send data that appears to be from your device, when it actually isn't. Although it's not clear what data you're sending, any untrusted data can be a security risk.Which bits do I need to keep private?When you create a device certificate on AWS IoT, you should see an image like this:Image from the Create and Activate a Device Certificate page of the AWS IoT documentation.The private key is the thing you really need to keep... private, and should definitely be stored on the read-protected memory if possible. The public key and certificate are designed to be shared, so if you're running out of space, you can safely move those to external storage. You can get a little bit more context on the page How does SSL/TLS work? at Information Security Stack Exchange and Public-key cryptography on Wikipedia. I think I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't include this image to explain why the private key needs to be secret:.Image from Wikipedia, released into the public domain.Your device's public key is what AWS IoT uses to sign messages to send to your device (but it does not prove who is sending the message). So, really, it's not a huge disaster if someone steals the public key, because it's not meant to be a secret.The private key is what your device uses to decrypt messages, so it's a slightly bigger problem if an attacker steals this.You also asked what would happen if the attacker stole the RootCA certificate. If someone stole AWS IoT's private key, it would be disastrous, but the RootCA certificate on your device isn't that. The RootCA.crt that Amazon give you is completely public, and the purpose is so that you can verify that you're not being attacked in any way (most likely a man-in-the-middle pretending to be AWS IoT's servers).What damage could a hacked device do?Your stolen device can only perform the actions listed in the policy. Try to follow the principle of least privilege; only grant your device the privileges it absolutely needs, so if the worst does happen, it can't wreak havoc too much. For your specific case: The thing is allowed to publish to only 2 channels (its name and a data feed channel) which is connected to a data processor which will ignore any rogue packets coming to it.That's good. Any attack should be isolated to just the two MQTT topics that the device can publish to, so it won't cause large scale harm.",595,0,2,0

Changing this (3) would only allow your device to be forced to connect to a rogue AWS service which is presumably hard to engineer access to. Even leaking just this key might allow someone to snoop or fake some transmissions (for example if the TLS layer can be somehow downgraded).So in summary, the risk is not simply in leaking information, there is a risk if the (supposedly trusted) firmware can be provided with un-trusted secure information.",203,0,0,0

1011,1006,1,27251,4,"You mention “certificates”, but from context, I think you're referring to two different things.Your device has a private key, which is unique to this device and not known outside the device. This key identifies your device. Anybody who can access that key can impersonate the device. That means that they can, in particular:Publish valid, but incorrect data on the channels that your device is legitimately authorized to publish to.Publish invalid data that will get the legitimate device banned.Possibly, depending on the use case, expose some private information of the owner of the device.This private key had better remain confidential.Your device probably has at least one public key, which allow it to recognize which servers it's talking to. It's ok if anybody can read this key: it's public. But an attacker should not be able to modify the key. Otherwise, they could communicate with the device and impersonate the server. This could allow them to do things like:Push a firmware update to the device.Push a configuration update to the device.Make the device upload its data to a different location.The good news is that this threat analysis is actually not very relevant. You do not need to sacrifice any security! (At least not confidentiality and authenticity properties — if you store stuff externally, then availability takes a hit, because that's one piece of the system that could go missing.)As long as you have at least 128 bits of storage that you can write to at least once, which you have and more, you can implement a secure remote storage solution. Use the limited-space on-device storage to store a secret key. This secret key must be unique per device; the STM32 has a hardware RNG, so you can generate it on the device during first boot. If your device didn't have a hardware RNG, you could generate the key in a secure off-device location and inject it onto the device.With this key, use authenticated encryption for things that you store off the device. When you want to read some data from external storage, load it, decrypt-and-verify it. When you want to write some data to external storage, encrypt-and-sign it. This guarantees that the data is as confidential and authentic as the data in the internal storage.Authenticated encryption is enough to guarantee the confidentiality and authenticity of the data, but it doesn't quite guarantee its integrity.If there's more than one chunk of data, then when the device reads back a chunk of data, it can't be sure that this is the correct chunk. Solution: include a unique identifier in the content of each chunk (e.g. start each chunk with one of ""AWS-IoT private key."", ""configuration CA certificate."", ""publishing server CA certificate."", ""user personal data."", …).If you update the data at some point, then when you read it back, you can't be sure that you're getting the latest version of that data. If someone can modify the external storage, they can't put fake data because that would fail the authenticity check, but they can restore old data, because what used to be authentic is still authentic. Solution: in each data chunk that is stored externally, include a counter which you increment each time you write a new version of that chunk. When you read a chunk back, verify that it's the expected version.To avoid bricking a device in case the external storage is damaged or otherwise lost, in the limited space you have space on internal storage, you should give priority to whatever is needed to reset the device to a “good” state, e.g. a factory reset. The second priority will be performance considerations.",597,0,0,0

If the device only has ROM and non-secure storage, then this approach is not possible. There must be a location where you can store the RNG state in such a way that your adversaries can neither read it nor modify it.The way this works is, when the device boots, it loads the current RNG state, and uses it to generate some enough random bytes for twice the size of the RNG state. Write the first half as the new saved RNG state, and use the second half as the initial RNG state for the current session. With any cryptographically secure PRNG, this yields a cryptographically secure PRNG. Note that it's critical that you don't reuse a stored RNG state, that's why you must write a new independent RNG state before you start using the RNG.The initial entropy injection can happen during manufacturing, or when the device is set up.

But unlike the [Nest] Protect, the Smart Battery doesn’t give you voice alerts, wireless interconnectivity, integrations with smart-home devices, or self-testing sensors [...]According to my understand (maybe flawed) of the word interconnectivity, it means something along the lines of this definition from Wikipedia: Interconnectivity refers to the state or quality of being connected together, or to the potential to connect in an easy and effective wayIf the Smart Battery is not in the state of being connected together with your phone, how would they communicate?

This is a crucial safety feature that can save you precious seconds in evacuating your home. Also, many states now require interconnected alarms for new construction, so if you do a significant remodel in your home, you don’t want to end up having to buy a different brand of alarm for the new area (most brands don’t play well with one another when it comes to interconnected alerts).The author of that article seems to use interconnected to refer to the alarms connecting together so that they all sound together in case of a fire. The Roost Smart Battery does not do this, because it just works by listening to detect your alarm going off with a piezoelectric sensor, according to TechHive: The detector relies on the high-pitched sound of the alarm to deform a piezo-electric sensor to trigger its own alarm. I intentionally installed the battery in the smoke detector in my master bedroom because its siren is defective—it makes more of a growl than a high-pitched squeal. But the Roost still went into an alarm state, perhaps after picking up the noise of the detector in the hallway.Your smoke alarm is still 'dumb' and can't share its state with other alarms, and the smart battery has no way of causing your alarm to trigger, either.The Roost Smart Battery is definitely connecting wirelessly with your phone, though.

Energy harvesting from thermal sources such as body heat and mechanical sources such as human motion have been proposed. There are also sensor network systems that harvest energy from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, ambient light levels in indoor environments are typically significantly lower than those found outdoors and highly dependent on the nature of the indoor environment considered. Recently, lowpower clock synchronization using electromagnetic energy radiating from AC power lines was proposed. In this paper, we go a step ahead and try to answer the question: Can energy be harvested from the electromagnetic energy radiating from AC power lines and use it to operate a wireless sensor network with a low duty-cycle?

1059,221,0,NA,1,"First of all, I should say that XML has been used for encapsulating realtime messages with some success, and at large scale, in particular for communicating IM and presence in XMPP. There also seem to be some companies that are intent on leveraging their XML knowledge to try to find yet another application area for this data representation system.However, not everyone is convinced that XML is the answer to everything in messaging systems. For example, there's been a noticeable shift in recent years to online systems that use JSON as a way to serialize data rather than XML, and if I put my developer hat on for a moment I would say that the tools to encode/decode from native representation (e.g. in Python, PHP, Javascript) seem a lot easier to use than for JSON than their equivalents for XML, even if XML has had more time to get those answers right. XML is a difficult representation for computers to handle, as it needs a relatively complex text parser, and then some kind of hierarchical representation to allow its data to be extracted in a program. Because there's so much text involved, you need quite a bit of memory available for encoding/decoding. Often it seems unclear that XML is adding much value to the representation of the data: if the core message is not deeply hierarchical, then adding a lot of textual chaff seems unnecessary, but paradoxically if there is a lot of hierarchy then decoding the message from its textual representation is going to be hard work and need a lot of resources. Also, the benefit of representing in text are not clear to me: When we first write and debug communication systems it is common to use monitoring/decoding tools (for example Wireshark) to help us to figure out what is going wrong. In the long term, everything is working fine, and no human will need to look in detail at the messages going back and forth (only computers). Computers prefer binary representation. The textual representation benefits no-one involved at any stage of deployment.XML is hard for humans to read (and manually construct) while being hard work for computers at the same time; It is therefore a system that is neither suitable for computers and nor is it suitable for humans.Importantly, IoT has some special constraints that make it desirable to be efficient. IoT devices will typically have limited processing power and storage (usually no large scale secondary storage, only some RAM and EEPROM). An IoT device might have the simplest possible communication links, maybe not even a TCP/IP stack. There will be a wide variety of microcontroller designs, not even at the level of sophistication where a standard operating system (e.g. Linux, Android) would be in use; this limits the number of off-the-shelf tools that will be lying around offering easy XML interfaces to use.In summary, I suspect that with IoT, data representation is better left on a case-by-case basis, depending on hardware constraints, style of communication (e.g. broadcast, datagram, reliable etc), frequency of communication and so on. XML certainly shouldn't be thought of as a sine qua non for IoT.",521,0,0,0

First the additional method from Texas Instruments, which is called RF switch harvesting technique. (The video is worth watching, the RF switch part starts at 2:29.) It is based on a magnetic switch which structure can be seen on the image below. On the drawing here in the red is the switch part the user will push. We have a magnet inside with the two poles. And this is creating a magnet field through this core back to the other pole.  When the user flips the switch, you can see the field changes. It goes the opposite direction through the core. And we know from Maxwell's equations that this change in magnetic field through these windings will produce a current. This is energy that we can harvest and make use of.The switch produces an AC current that needs to be converted to DC current which can charge a capacitor. Then the energy stored in the capacitor can be used to power a low-power wireless MCU.TI has actually realized this and they were able to supply enough energy for 21 milliseconds for the wireless MCU.The reference design is a Solar Dice which can wirelessly transmit an accelerometer's data to a smartphone. The solution does not use a battery and quite compact. Worth reading or browsing the provided test data, schematics and other documents.",265,0,2,0

[...] The use of a geo-fence is called geo-fencing, and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account.There are various ways that you can implement this, depending on what sort of device you use and how much code you're willing to write:How-To Geek has an article on how to use geo-fencing with IFTTT. You could then connect that to something like the Maker channel, which can send POST requests to your garage door.Android also provides a geo-fencing API which you could use if you were so inclined. This would be far more involved than using IFTTT, though.Of course, this answer neglects the other side of the question: how do you make the garage door open when it receives a message? That aspect would probably be best addressed in a different question, but if you used the IFTTT Maker channel to send a request, you would need to have some sort of networking capability on the device that opens the door.

1067,1049,1,11761,6,"The problem is essentially one of receivers and of power. A ""find my keys"" type of beacon needs to be small enough to attach to your keychain and you probably don't want to have to regularly recharge the beacon (you wouldn't lose your keys if they're always in their charger) so that requires either:a passive technology without a battery.an active technology running of a battery that is extremely power efficient and doesn't require recharging/battery replacement for months or preferably years. Then you also need a receiver to locate the beacon and in the case of a passive technology you also need a transmitter to power and activate the beacon. The options for receivers/transmitters are either:a dedicated and/or proprietary receiver unit, which allows the manufacturer to select optimised frequencies, protocols and technologies, but which means you need to bring out that receiver when you need to find your keys.use the smartphone which you already carry as the receiver. That makes the solution a lot cheaper, you only have to buy beacons, but also limits the beacon manufacturer to technologies, frequencies and protocols that are commonly implemented on smartphones. The advantage of passive beacons is that they're likely to be quite reliable and cheap to manufacture, the expense is in a transmitter/receiver combo that works from a reasonable distance. Most likely you'll need special purpose device to take the role of tranmitter/receiver as smartphones currently only support NFC as a passively powered protocol, near-field communication with a range of a couple of cm.An example that works over significant distances would be the Recco beacons and receivers marketed for finding people buried by avalanches. For active beacons the main issue is power consumption. As you listed there are a number of different protocols and solutions that are low powered and energy efficient, but since nobody really seems to want to depend on separate receivers but would rather use a smartphone effectively that means either Bluetooth or WiFi. As currently phones can only be connected to one WiFi network at the time and when operating as a hotspot can't be connected to another WiFI network at all, that is probably not the most desirable protocol.With Bluetooth 4 and above on the other hand a large number of devices can be connected simultaneously and that standard also comes with the Bluetooth low energy variant. You also get a reasonable distance from Bluetooth.  So should we stay on BT beacons or can other protocols be more reliable especially for home usage?In summary: unless you are willing to use a specific receiver to find your beacon Bluetooth Low Energy is the best choice.

1081,1048,1,34369,5,"Key here is the datasheet as linked in Jimmy Westberg's answer. The sensor will output:  The 4-20 mA vibration transmitters are piezo-electric accelerometers of compression type and provide a 4-20 mA output signal proportional to the true RMS value of vibration velocity. So the output of this sensor is a current signal between 4 mA and 20 mA (not a voltage) that is proportional to the RMS value of vibration velocity. To read this sensors output the current will have to be converted to a voltage using a transimpedance amplifier (current-to-voltage converter) or measuring the voltage drop acros a well defined series resistor.However as the sensor output is the true RMS value of vibrations in the specified frequency range (2..10,000 Hz) it is not possible to obtain the frequency (or to be more precise the wide frequency band) of the vibration with this sensor. To detect the frequency spectrum a measurement of the time waveform of the vibration amplitudes would be necessary.This booklet about vibration measurement gives some more insight.The RMS value is typically used in quantifying the vibration level: The RMS value is the most relevant measure of amplitude because it both takes the time history of the wave into account and gives an amplitude value which is directly related to the energy content, and therefore the destructive abilities of the vibration. The purpose of this sensor seems to be for monitoring of machinery where the actual time waveform of the vibration is of little interest. A single value (the RMS value) is sufficient to monitor the operation of the machine against a threshold value. It significantly simplifies measurement. Experience has shown that the overall RMS value of vibration velocity measured over the range 10 to 1000 Hz gives the best indication of a vibration's severity. A probable explanation is that a given velocity level corresponds to a given energy level so that vibration at low and high frequencies are equally weighted from a vibration energy point of view. In practice many machines have a reasonably flat velocity spectrum. ",341,0,1,0

1100,1096,0,NA,4,"Baile, I think that we are missing a fine distinction here.When you speak of a Posix like standard for IoT, I think that you are speaking of libraries which wrap a protocol.As one who has been employed for (cough) decades implementing protocol stacks for telephony and satellite communication, I can say (as you are probably aware) that these protocols are, by need, already strictly defined. For instance, Zigbee is governed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4These standards lay down the messages to be transmitted and define that byte 0 means this, bytes 1 through 4 mean that, etc, so that devices from disparate manufactures can communicate with each other (that’s the theory, anyway; I could tell you some horror stories ;-)As I said, for any given protocol, there can be a plethora of manufactures. And for any given manufacturer, there can be multiple software libraries, which is your problem.Your task is too difficult as long as there are multiple APIS available, which wrap each protocol. Sadly, there will only be a Posix-like API only if one company becomes dominant. There might be a thin possibility if a major government throws a lot of money at it, but I can’t see that happening. The only other chance I as Linux-like effort by the Open Source community.Btw, I don’t think that you make it clear enough that your will not be just another static code analyser, that it is not intended for general code, but for certain specific APIs.

Thing types allow you to store description and configuration information that is common to all things associated with the same thing type. This simplifies the management of things in the thing registry. For example, you can define a LightBulb thing type. All things associated with the LightBulb thing type share a set of attributes: serial number, manufacturer, and wattage. When you create a thing of type LightBulb (or change the type of an existing thing to LightBulb) you can specify values for each of the attributes defined in the LightBulb thing type.Thing Types do not mean all the devices are treated as one device; each Thing receives its own ARN regardless of whether it has a Thing Type or not.Each Thing should be able to subscribe to a custom topic (if you're using the MQTT broker), even though it has a Thing Type.

1104,-1,NA,NA,11,"This is a subject I have been thinking of for a while, especially because the ""IoT"" concept has been floating around a lot lately.I will start with what I mean when I say ""IoT"". I know that the term IoT could mean different things and that sometimes it's misused. It could be a term that is not clearly defined and can lead to big discussions around what does it exactly mean, I myself don't know the proper and widely accepted definition of the term. So for me IoT is a concept, a concept that defines the ability to connect to an embedded device remotely through the internet either from another embedded device or from a cell phone. As simple as that.On this context, the purpose of the connection doesn't matter, if you can connect one device in your office with another one at home, or if you can connect to one device at home from your cell phone, all this through the internet, then we are talking about IoT devices (the embedded devices, not the phone).So, having agreed on what I mean by IoT I will now describe what I'm trying to achieve.What I'm trying to achieve is precisely that what I describe on my definition of IoT. I want to have one or several embedded devices at home connected to my internet router, either by ethernet or wifi and be able to connect to them remotely with another embedded devices in a remote location (and by remote I mean not on the same network) and maybe also to be able to connect to them with a monitoring app on my phoneFor example, I may have a simple embedded device acting as an on/off switch hooked op to my garage door opener and another embedded device acting as a big red button on my desk at work so that I can push the red button in my desk and the garage door opens.Another example would be to have an embedded device with ADC capabilities that can monitor the temperature of my house and send me an alert when it reaches a threshold. The notification could be received either by a simple android app or by another embedded device with a little screen sitting on my desk at work.These examples may be silly but are just to illustrate the possible scenarios and use cases for what I'm trying to achieve. At the end, the idea is the same, connect one embedded device with another through the internet.Another thing to clarify is that the data exchange between these devices will be very lightweight, just a couple of bytes every time, it is not that hundreds of kilobytes are needed to be interchanged between devices.Additionally, the kind of ""embedded devices"" I'm referring to are simple but capable devices based on 100MHz or 200MHz cortex-m4 microcontrollers. And that is important to clarify because there won't be any Linux or complex libraries running on those devices. In the end, is such a waste of resources and completely unnecessary to have a powerful processor running Linux just to turn on and off a light bulb. In any case, I'm planning to use a BeagleBoard, Raspberry Pi, or any other board like that as my embedded devices. Just Microcontrollers because no more complexity than that is needed.I don't know much about IoT platforms and those kinds of complex solutions out there. When I started this journey of finding out a way of connecting one embedded device with another through the internet I stumbled upon a couple of sites with IoT services.I know that there are some IoT cloud services like:BlynkGoogle Cloud PlatformExosite IoT PlatformAyla IoT PlatformJust to name a few. The main issues with those are cost and complexity. You have to pay to get those services and also you have to learn how to implement all the services they have, in case you need them all, and their APIs and maybe a bunch of other stuff that doesn't seem necessary to me to be able just to interchange some bytes between devices. I just want something simpler than that, something I can do myself.You may say that implementing my own ""cloud"", if that is something I have to do, is not simple and sometimes is better to use those kinds of services for the sake of simplicity but there are two main reasons I want to know how to implement my own IoT services.The main reason is that I want to do it myself. I don't want to rely on a 3rd party to connect my devices to each other and since I'll be developing the code and the hardware for my devices then it feels better to also create my own means to connect them as IoT devices.The second reason is to learn how to do it. By knowing all the necessary things I need to achieve this, I will have a better understanding about the IoT world.Also, I want to mention that I'm proficient in C and I use Linux as my everyday OS at work as well as in my home, so please avoid windows stuff because that is useless to me. I'm not afraid of anything I have to implement in C for my embedded devices or on Linux to implement whatever is needed to achieve my goal.So my question is, what is it necessary to implement, and where, to be able to connect two or more embedded devices to each other with the purpose of data interchange between them?This question What can I use to create an IoT on our own server? have something similar but is closed and doesn't have any answers, also assumes an already existing cloud infrastructure to be used.

1105,1104,0,NA,8,"Maybe I missed the point of the question, but I think this is a good start at an answer.You need three things, at a minimum.An always-on compute node to aggregate your data. This does not need to be powerful, It could be a process running on your NAS, or even (in theory) on your router. For simplicity, assume it is a Raspberry Pi. This could also provide any fancy radio protocols that you decide to support in the future. Although in theory you could run peer-to-peer with all nodes exposed to the internet, it is easier to nominate one as the master and have this handle the data collation and publishing (to the app/user). Of course, the hub can be a node too, particularly if you use WiFi nodes which are moderately powerful.A suitable software stack to allow the endpoints to submit their data to your hub node. mqtt is the sort of thing you need here, plus an OS to run it on.DNS and port-forwarding to facilitate access to your server from the wider internet.Then don't forget security.

1106,1104,0,NA,9,"Lightweight devices, and couple of bytes date rates ask for using MQTT, as it has already been mentioned.

Again if you like coding you can implement your own MQTT broker. Personally I found Mosquitto great for this purpose.Disadvantage that all of your sensor nodes would need TCP/IP connection.Battery friendly solution could be to use LoraWAN or ZigBee enabled sensor/actuator nodes and implement a gateway on a Raspberry/BeagleBone which can host a simple web server too that can be accessed from your phone or other devices.In every case it all comes down to make your hub, gateway or server accessible outside your private network. There are more ways of doing this and the main concern is always security. This is the most risky part in my opinion.The basic requirements are summarised quite well by @Sean.",216,0,3,0
1107,1104,0,NA,7,"You've questioned both previous answers about the need for a controller/hub. Consider that to make things happen, you need rules to exist. If you want to push a big red button to open a garage door, some rule has to tie the sensor (button) to the desired action (opening the door). There are two ways to make that happen: you can put the rule directly in the button, or you can put the rule in a separate computer.Let's think more about the direct solution. If you teach the button about the garage door, then your button holds the rules internally. The button needs the ID of the garage door, so if you replace the garage door, the button doesn't work. If the button is on your desk, and your house uses a proprietary network, the button has to know both the address of your home's gateway and the address of the door. The button needs to know the specific protocol to signal your door to open - do all manufacturers make compatible buttons that know about all door signals? The button can't do anything else unless you reprogram it - do you have a flash programmer for the button's chip laying around, and is that programmer compatible with any other devices? If you want the garage door to open, and 5 minutes later close, your button needs all the complexities of maintaining a real-time clock. Your button won't know the state of the door, making it hard to know if you're closing the door or opening it. And how do you back up the rules so that if your button breaks, your replacement button can do the job? On the plus side, it sounds cheap: you don't need a separate computer. With a controller, things are different. All messages from all sensors are delivered to the controller. Each sensor is simple: send the signal to the controller. The controller can then apply whatever inputs are needed to very complex rules: it can check the sunshine sensor and not turn on the outdoor lights unless it's dark, or not run the sprinklers if the average rainfall for the month is above average and the current temperature is five degrees below average. The controller can keep track of state. This could be important if you want a ""close garage door"" button but not an ""open garage door"" button (when I'm away from home, I rarely want to open the door, but I definitely want to close it if it is accidentally left open.) The controller can provide the place for device drivers that know how to listen to buttons and other drivers that know how to speak to doors. The controller may be more upgradeable to new devices and device types than a tiny chip tucked inside a button. The controller can also have more complex logic for infrastructure tasks such as delivering messages by offering certain levels of service. For example, the MQTT protocol allows for three different levels: try to deliver the message once, deliver it repeatedly until it's been seen at least once, or deliver it once and only once.The controller offers an architecturally logical place to consolidate all messaging to and from a communication gateway, allowing the use of an external interface. This means your button and your phone can both send signals, and the rules can figure out that either one is allowed to open the garage door. The gateway can also provide the security. You don't have to put your button and your garage door on the internet; you can put them both on private isolated networks and use the gateway to carry the signals. The controller also provides a single point to back up all the rules for your system. The downsides to the controller are added latency and extra complexity. Surprisingly, a controller doesn't make the cost go up appreciably. You can implement a controller on a Raspberry Pi for less than the cost of one average remotely controllable light switch. Don't discount the idea on the basis of cost alone.",676,0,0,0

1114,1085,0,NA,5,"Building upon several years of deploying outdoor wireless sensor networks, I would like to add the following hint:Think ahead and do not underestimate the problems arising from humidity!I will answer your question by providing some pitfalls with humidity in outdoor devices. However, please consider these general guidelines when planning a wireless sensor network.It is very simple to build a housing that keeps the rain from falling onto your sensor, but as @Ghanima pointed out it very much depends on what you really want to measure.However, the main problem is not rain but humidity. This is roughly what happens with not properly constructed devices in outdoor environments, starting with a dry housing:The outdoor temperature rises. The temperature of the air in your device rises even more (especially when placed in the sun).Therefore, the air pressure in your device rises, it expands and some part diffuses out of the device.The temperature falls. Thus humid (!) air diffuses back into the device. The humid air condensates inside the device.The cycle repeats, but the temperature inside the device is not high enough to evaporate the water again. Therefore, water accumulates inside the device. Every day a very tiny amount of water is added.Several possible approaches to counteract this problem:Sealing the device Trust me, that does not work with household items. Even if your freezer box has a seal and silicone works good in the bathroom, both do not prevent the flow of humid air! Dipping the device into water without any water coming in, does not mean that humid air will stay out, too! If you want to go that way, buy industrial grade (IP rated) housings and do not drill additional holes into it!Drilling a hole into the bottom What, you just said the opposite? The reason is simple: If you can not avoid that humid air comes into your device, you should at least avoid that water accumulates inside. For many electronic components some humidity is not such a big problem, but accumulating water is!Air-conditioning Heating up the device prevents condensation. This is the common approach for large and sensitive outdoor devices, especially if the condensation itself induces problems (for example for optics).A pressure-compensating diaphragm Not that cheap but works quite good in practice by equalizing the air pressures. There are also cable feed-throughs with an integrated diaphragm.",385,0,1,0

Langendoen, Koen, Aline Baggio, and Otto Visser. ""Murphy loves potatoes: Experiences from a pilot sensor network deployment in precision agriculture."" 20th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) 2006.Be prepared for those and many other problems that could arise and plan ahead and focus on your target!You should ask yourself the following question: Why do I want to build the deployment? Is it really the data itself that I want to collect, do I want to evaluate and develop network protocols or do I want to develop and test new hardware? The answer results in very distinct paths:I want to get the data!In that case, try to rely on proven practices as much as you can. Buy standard hardware, use industrial grade housings, provide much more batteries than you think your hardware requires and monitor them! Use already existing and well-tested software and do not build everything from scratch! Even think about the following: Do I really need wireless connections?Of course, there are many applications where you really need hundreds of energy harvesting, wireless, self-organizing and tiny devices. But just using these techniques because they are cool is a waste of money and time.If you really want to get the data, nothing is more frustrating than to notice that just for the most interesting day, no data is available because water has accumulated in your devices (been there...).I want to improve protocols for wireless sensor networks!In that case, really focus on the core. I talk about network protocols here, but it equally holds for all other procedures and algorithms in the IoT context.For most protocols, it does not care if they transport real-world data or just some pseudo-random noise. So why not take the easy road, throw away your sensors and just generate some random data? I recommend the following procedure:Think about which problem you want to solve. What is your research question?Read! Many things have been done already. Many concepts have been shown to be good, many others not. Starting with network protocols from scratch is just a waste of time.Do some theoretical evaluations. Is it really possible to improve a given protocol or is it already at a principle boundary? Shannon can not be fooled!Do simulations. I suggest the OMNeT++/INET framework, but there are many frameworks out there. But please do not start from scratch. Most components are already there for your convenience. Test if your ideas work in the controlled environment of a simulator.Work on the hardware implementation. Does your implementation work at least on your desk?Test it in an already existing testbed. One example is the FIT IoT-LAB. This allows you to test your implementation with real-world hardware without the burden of all the problems arising from self-made testbeds.Now you can finally plan your real-world deployment and tailor it to the specific problem that you want to address. Until now you should have a good idea how dense your network has to be, how many devices are meaningful, how they should be distributed, which kind of data has to be provided and so on. Then go to ""I want to get the data!"", but this time your data is the performance measure that you want to test.Yes, this is a long way to go, but there are students doing this during a six-month master's thesis, so it is feasible and definitely worth the effort! There is already so much existing research in this area that skipping a step does not pay off in the end.I want to build cool hardware!If you are mostly interested in building cool hardware, start with playing around with existing hardware. Then think about what this hardware lacks and what could be improved. Maybe you just want to create a nice and waterproof housing and see how it works in practice.You will need several iterations anyway, so start with something oversized (e.g. in terms of RAM or persistent memory) and then strip away unnecessary parts in future iterations. This is much more satisfactory than recognizing that the software you want to use is just 1 KB too large after production.Also, provide good possibilities to debug and evaluate your hardware.Even if you do not need a serial or USB interface for the final application, it speeds up the development a lot. If you are actually building a housing, attach a humidity sensor and monitor it constantly instead of just waiting and checking manually. If you integrate an energy harvester, monitor the energy flows, even if a precise power measurement IC might be oversized for a final application.For the software part, rely on existing components! If you are building a testbed because you like to build hardware and you do not really know what to do with it, publish it!

Also, this information may be useful for somebody with a similar question.I don't like the idea of having to go to my router configuration and configure the port forwarding because that means that I have to configure a device that in spite of being part of the IoT infrastructure, is not one of ""my"" devices. It has to be as less disruptive of the already existing home network as possible. Also, I've had instances where I don't know the admin password of a particular router and it has been really difficult to get it.I'm sure that there is a way around that even if that means having a more powerful IoT HUB maybe running Linux, I just don't know what that could be. It is OK to have a bit more complex HUB if that ""alternate"" way allows avoiding that port forwarding configuration.I say that I'm sure there is a way thinking about how applications like team viewer don't need to configure port forwarding.So the question is, does anyone know a way of ""exposing"" an IoT embedded device to the external internet in order to access it from anywhere in the world that does not involve port forwarding?",278,0,1,0
1118,1117,1,1450,4,"If you can't port forward your router, you might have to resort to hole punching: Hole punching is a technique in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind firewalls or behind routers that use network address translation (NAT). To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive firewalls or routers accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.The NAT on your router means that clients outside of your network can't connect to open ports of devices inside your network, but it doesn't restrict devices in your network from connecting to a 'broker'. Using a little bit of indirection, you can establish a direct connection between two devices without actually opening any ports - this is essentially what services like Skype and Hamachi do.Of course, this does require an external server to co-ordinate the connection, and you would probably want to trust the server that was performing the hole punching.Peer-to-Peer Communication Across Network Address Translators by Bryan Ford, Pyda Srisuresh and Dan Kegel is an interesting read for more information on the mechanisms of hole punching and how reliable it is.",238,0,2,0

The high level topology is equally suitable for a farm monitoring application covering several kilometres with thousands or sensors, tracking parking spaces in a city, or lighting management in an office building.I'll treat the problem approximately in layers of device hierarchy, which might correspond to increasing complexity of an installation, or pulling in specific use case scenarios. Here is my generalised diagram covering the whole network.Node levelThe individual node in my diagram is a WiFi connected lamp with a local physical override switch. The node often has both sensor and control functions, and a small amount of local compute/storage. Ideally, the node can act autonomously. The node can take control from local switches, directly over the LAN (if it has WiFi/Bluetooth), or from either the local hub or the cloud. A node will frequently maintain a persistent TCP connection with the hub or cloud.One location typically contains several nodes, with different functions, using various connectivity options. A smart-home might collect indoor/outdoor temperature, activity and video data. Remote sensors may use disparate connections to the internet.Hub Level In a smart home, there might be several hubs (one for each device vendor), aggregation or hierarchy. The hub can be combined in the router, or stand-alone. The hub doesn't even need to be active in the network (other than to forward packets). However, the hub might be responsible for relaying commands to a node - commands originating from either other locally connected nodes or from a remote server. The hub might implement store-forward of data, compression or filtering of data. Really, the hub is just a facilitator. Today, the hub is the first part of the network that has the ability to provide public DNS, which makes it able to publish network structure information to the full system. As described in this question a hub is often necessary to bridge between Wired/WiFi TCP-IP to a low-power radio protocol, such as ZigBee or BT-LE.Roaming Terminals Otherwise known as your smartphone. These are often the primary point of user interaction. A simple node can present it's entire user-interface through a smartphone, once the node can establish either a direct or a mediated link with a specific device. Achieving this fundamentally requires a mechanism for establishing trust/ownership/pairing. A terminal can establish if it's own hub is on the local network, if it needs to perform all communication via an external server, or if it is able to lookup the IP address which allows direct routing to it's 'home' hub. The latter scenario usually requires that the router is configured for port forwarding.Cloud service It is common for the cloud service to perform the majority of the work in the stack, although this is not always necessary (and not all implementations will require any cloud function). The most useful feature that an external (publicly addressed) server can provide is orchestration. Every node and intermediate element of the network is usually able to communicate over a direct channel to this server, and the server can easily pass messages from one device to the others. The server can aggregate data and present visualisations to the user. Based on the user's configuration, it can also forward information to other users (access and heating control can be granted to guests for example, flood/fire/intrusion warnings could use other network options to generate alerts). The cloud is also well placed to take in other data sources, so modifying heating profiles based on forecast and calendar information, or feeding local sensor information into local forecasting models, generating alerts for utility providers and so on.",611,0,1,0

1133,1090,1,59467,4,"There are many factors in choosing whether to process data on-device or in the cloud.Benefits of processing in the cloudIf the algorithm uses floating-point or runs on a GPU, it might not be possible to run on the embedded processor in the sensor.Even if it doesn't, if the algorithm was developed in a high-level language, it might be too expensive (in developer time) to port it to run on the sensor.Offloading computation from the sensor may increase its battery life (depending on how this affects network/radio use).Running the algorithm in the cloud allows it to combine the data from many sensors and make a system-level decision. In this example, that might mean filtering across different cars' sensors, so that washing one car doesn't cause a rain warning in every car.Processing in the cloud allows to distribute the information to many places without having to have a mesh network, which is a complicated architecture.You can log more data, which enables better analytics, audit, and development of better algorithms.Benefits of processing on-boardIf the raw sensor data is high-bandwidth, it might use less battery to summarise the data and send the summary (depending on what processing is needed to summarise it). This might mean that instead of sending an 8-bit moisture reading 100 times a second, you filter it and send a 1-bit wet/dry flag every 10 seconds.You might go further, and only wake up the network at all when the sensor has something interesting-looking to report (e.g. the wet/dry state changes)Reducing the network bandwidth at the sensor end also reduces it at the server end, so you can scale the service to more users (more sensors) very cheaply.It might be possible to run the service with the same or reduced functionality even when the network is unavailable. In this example, your car might be able to warn you about slippery roads it sees itself, but not give you advance warning from other cars.OverallUsually, some combination of the two is optimal. You might do as much processing as you can afford to do on the device, to reduce the need for the network as much as you can, and then run more sophisticated algorithms in the cloud that can combine more inputs or use more compute power.You might start out running all of your processing in the cloud (because it was prototyped in Matlab or Python) and port parts gradually to Rust to enable offline functionality, when you have developer time to spend on it.You might process the data heavily on the device in normal use but also sample and log the raw data sometimes, so that you can upload it to the cloud later (when network is more available) for your analytics.",449,0,0,0

1138,1130,1,28564,7,"Push vs PollYour proposed solution of sending frequent AJAX requests sounds a lot like polling - you're sending a request every so often to check if the state has changed. It would make far more sense to push changes to the server when the piezo sensor detects a change.It's the difference between this: Server: Is there someone at the door? Sensor: No. Server: Is there someone at the door? Sensor: No. Server: Is there someone at the door? Sensor: No. ... repeat ad infinitum ...And this: Sensor: There's someone at the door!The first example is polling, and the second is pushing. You can tell which one will have lower power usage, less complex code and reduced network usage.HTTP or Something Else?An AJAX request is sent over HTTP, so it's quite heavyweight and requires several TCP handshakes per connection (unless you use Keep-Alive). It may be worth considering alternative protocols such as MQTT (there's some good explanation in the question 'When and why to use MQTT protocol?', which has a very similar problem to yours).A message broker like MQTT might be a little bit more powerful than you really need in your current situation, but one MQTT broker could easily be expanded if you chose to add more devices to your smart home network, whereas your current system of AJAX requests would quickly fall apart. Imagine four or five different devices polling each other; it'd quickly lead to your network becoming overloaded and it would be a massive drain on power usage.Node and Web SocketsUsing web sockets and Node would solve the issue of using push instead of poll, so it would be a good idea in my opinion. However, I suspect polling would work if you really didn't want to learn Node.If you want an extensible solution that will work when you expand your smart home, definitely go with pushing - it'll save a lot of trouble and tears. If you just want a quick proof of concept, polling will probably work.My personal advice is that you should either learn web sockets or investigate using a message broker like MQTT. You could use a client library like Mosquitto-PHP (with a guide by HiveMQ) to simplify using MQTT in PHP, or just go with Node and web sockets. I suspect the learning resources for Node and web sockets will be better, but MQTT tends to be favoured for smart home/IoT environments.",399,0,3,0

1169,1168,1,0,8,"As a consumerYour options are often quite limited as a consumer, but you can minimise your risks in a few ways through carefully selecting the products you use and how you connect them.Check what happens when your device loses Internet connectivityUsually, you can just do a quick Google search to see what happens when a certain device disconnects from the Internet. Some devices will simply fail completely if their connection to a remote cloud server is lost, like the Amazon Echo: Your Echo requires an active Wi-Fi connection to speak, process your commands, and stream media.Sometimes, there's a good reason (for example, the Echo has to stream commands to the cloud to process your instructions, as stated in 'Is the Amazon Echo &#39;always listening&#39; and sending data to the cloud?'), but for others, it may just be an oversight or design flaw in your product.If you physically have the device, you could try unplugging your router to see what happens—this might not be a great test, because it's more likely a remote server will break but local connections will still work, but it's something to try.With enough time to waste use productively to improve your setup, you could potentially sniff packets from your devices, then apply a router-level block to certain domains—this way, you'd know what happened if mydeviceserver.com went down completely. Of course, this would take a long time so it might not be practical to test all of your devices in a large home with lots of 'smart' devices.Use local connectivityIf you're just turning your lights on from your smart switch, you might not need to route all the traffic through the Internet, into a cloud server thousands of miles away, and back to your lightbulb—you might just be able to route the command through local devices instead. A lot of the time, these devices will use a protocol like ZigBee or Z-Wave, so you might need a hub to co-ordinate the traffic (see 'Why do I need hubs for some devices when automating my home?').As a developerFor developers of IoT devices, careful design of a device can avoid problems like the recent S3 outage from affecting consumers. Of course, IoT designers aren't always known for careful design, but if you're reading this, you're probably not in that group.Design services to be redundantFor Amazon S3's recent outage in particular, there may not have been much you could do. There are some reports that cross-region replication could have potentially prevented services from going down, as explained in this question on DevOps Stack Exchange, but it's debated whether that's really true or just poor advice. If feasible, having some sort of redundancy or backup would be ideal—although the costs are greater, the additional reliability is greatly needed—otherwise, people's lights stop responding, power switches refuse to work, etc.Add better support for scenarios without Internet connectionsI listed 'Use local connectivity' under the ways that a consumer could avoid this issue, but it's a losing battle. The devices often don't support connecting in any other way than through their approved web service, and manufacturers are reluctant to spend developer time on this. If the support was greater, there would be less reliance on cloud services, which benefits the manufacturer too, because they don't need to pay for so much server capacity.With all these options, why were so many devices affected?Because no-one wants to spend the time—designing any sort of reliable system takes a lot of time and effort, and it's often far more complex than the comparable 'dumb' solution (e.g. simple electrical switches). Why isn't software as reliable as a car? Because the software has so much more complexity, yet isn't tested nearly as rigorously as a car would be. The same issue seems to apply with IoT—controlling devices through a network is far more complex, so things can go wrong far more easily, as we've seen with the recent S3 incident.",648,0,5,0

You could potentially replicate that too across different providers, but at this point it starts to get expensive, because you are paying multiple times for the storage of your data, and it could easily get out of sync, adding complexity to the service.Imagine setting your smart thermostat to 20°C on your phone—it might synchronise that data with cloud server #1, which then crashes before the data is pushed to the other storage, so cloud server #2 thinks that you still want your thermostat at 10°C, and you get home to a freezing house.Essentially, making reliable IoT services is hard, but criticising poor design is easy, it seems.",228,0,0,0

As you point out there are enough models where most of the cost only applies when actually used.Like on this Wikipedia load-balancing page the load balancer is mostly pictured as singular instance. Even though that's a vast simplification there is very little cross-provider load-balancing. Thus, if your AWS load balancer shuts down there is no use in having tons of Google Cloud Functions and OneDrive storage available. Your IoT devices won't find their way towards those services. They will be looking at the false domains/IPs for your cloud service.The rest is set up redundantly anyways. What happened to Amazon is that they inadvertently shut down their single point of failure. That one server with the big red never shut it down sign. By mistake they took down the indexing server for the S3 on the east coast. One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region. This subsystem is necessary to serve all GET, LIST, PUT, and DELETE requests.Essentially the service that knows what's where. However you design your infrastructure there will always be similar points. Just take it from Amazon, even the number #1 cloud provider didn't dare to touch that system. While this is an operation that we have relied on to maintain our systems since the launch of S3, we have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years.If you read their blog to the end, they have no actual solution to that. They are just trying to reduce the chance it happens again.

IoT Hub devices never act as a 'server', and this is a crucial part of the security model in Azure IoT. The definitive model on this is encapsulated in Clemens Vasters' 'Service Assisted Communication'.Therefore devices are always 'polling' an external service in order to send data or receive commands. The APIs make it look like data is being sent to a device, but it is always the device making the outgoing connection.IoT hub does this in two ways:By sending data to the device endpoint /devices/{deviceId}/messages/devicebound. This is an AMQP messaging endpoint, similar to a queue or topic subscription. The device, when reading commands, needs to acknowledged receipt if needed, which is part of the underlying AMQP protocol. This works the same with MQTT, and https is a valid fallback.The API wraps all of this up for you. There are additional concepts, such as 'direct methods' which are an API wrapper around essentially the same underlying message protocolBy using the server-side device twin, which is a way to logically keep properties in sync between device and server. You set a property on the device twin, and when the device syncs up that property will be synced to the device. This is less message-based and built on top of the LWM2M device management protocol.A lot of the 'polling', connecting, sharing connections, receipts, etc should be taken care of as part of the AMQP (or MQTT) protocol, which in turn is wrapped up in the IoT Hub SDK.

The intent schema defines which actions can be performed, and the slots for custom data to be sent to your API. The sample utterances provide examples of how a user can trigger each intent.When the user activates your Skill, Alexa will try to match what they said to one of your skill's sample utterances. If it does match, it will send an HTTPS request to your server to ask for a response.Your server provides a response (if all goes well) and then Alexa will give feedback to the user who triggered your skill.The AMAZON.LITERAL slot allows you to accept virtually any input. Note that currently it is only supported in the English (US) region—English (UK) and German skills cannot use AMAZON.LITERAL.Your intent schema might look like this:And your sample utterances might be like this:When using AMAZON.LITERAL, you need to provide lots of sample utterances—at least one sample for each possible length of input, but ideally more.

You could perhaps generate sample utterances from customer data (so long as personal information is removed beforehand!) so that the most common utterances are in your samples—I suspect Alexa will be slightly biased towards recognising utterances similar to the samples.Amazon discourage AMAZON.LITERAL slots though, and would prefer you to use custom slot types, which require you to list the possible inputs. It's important to remember that: A custom slot type is not the equivalent of an enumeration. Values outside the list may still be returned if recognized by the spoken language understanding system.

Do Android smartwatches have something like what I Can't Wake Up has?Example:Let's say it is 11:59am. I want to be reminded of the time at 12:05pm and then be reminded every 5 minutes.Currently, I am using my phone.So either I set a timer for 5 minutes when it's 12pm or I set an alarm to ring at 12:05pm. If timer: I want an option to autorestart after dismiss (so far I haven't found any). If alarm: I want an option to snooze not so easily (with I Can't Wake Up, I can make it so that I have to slide up to snooze or slide down to dismiss).But it's a hassle to get my phone out every time wherein sometimes I have to first unlock the phone first snoozing the alarm (I Can't Wake Up has 'Quit Block', but I have yet to try this).I'm hoping some smartwatch has the ability to go off at 12:05pm or 5 minutes after I set the timer (which would be around 12pm) so that I just have to swipe my watch instead of taking out my phone.I haven't been able to find such features for any smartwatch, but I may be using wrong keywords.",251,0,2,0

1206,1202,0,NA,3,"If you have no intention of communicating with a device that doesn't use ZigBee, you probably wouldn't need a hub.You might be interested in 'Why do I need hubs for some devices when automating my home?'—one of the main reasons the hub is needed at all is so that a ZigBee device can communicate with your Wi-Fi router and connect to the Internet. If you don't actually need to do that, you might not need a hub at all.A ZigBee network (whether it's a mesh, star or tree) requires a coordinator device. There's a brief overview here, but one device needs to be responsible for forming and administering the network, so a hub is a straightforward option to fill that gap.You can see in this diagram that the SmartThings hub acts as a coordinator for the home network—that's where the hub is useful.If you were confident that the device would be able to handle the demands, you could just make ZigBee A the coordinator and run a mesh network between your devices—they'd be able to communicate fine without a hub, so long as you didn't want to connect them to the Internet.If you were just connecting a switch to a lightbulb, you could do it without a hub. However, at that point, ask yourself: is this really better than just connecting the bulb to a switch with a wire? The whole point of automating your home is so that you can control things remotely from other devices (or a hub to schedule things automatically). ",254,0,2,0

Anderson: Comparing Messaging Techniques for the IoT, OpenIoTSummit, Linux Foundation.The slides for his talk are Available HereOn Slide 26 and 41 minutes of the video he is discussing about how (let me paraphrase): Cellular carriers prefer that their IoT consumers use HTML, XML or JSON type of messages since they consume more Data. More Data means they can charge the consumers more money for the service.I understand that a lot of proprietary protocols viz. SigFox, Wireless HART or Z Wave have lower data rates and sending bulky data over such carriers can be an expensive affair. QuestionAre there some other light-weight messaging formats that are being used for usage in Proprietary Protocols which makes them cost-efficient solutions for current and future IoT consumers?

1212,1209,0,NA,3,"The big advantage of a markup based format is that you retain flexibility in the choice of what data you transmit. This is hugely important in an evolving ecosystem where you anticipate a service evolving over several years of development.Although a tightly coded binary data structure will be efficient to transmit, you need to decide up-front at a minimum what the structure will look like. When, later you realise that even one field needs expansion, you're stuck. Even rolling out an update to the protocol is hard, since you can't obsolete an old encoding till every endpoint is updated.This suggests that the optimum approach is to mix minimalist packets and markup based encoding (using the latter as a fallback). The value of this depends on the highest bandwidth payloads. If you're already transferring frequent video sized chunks, optimising the infrequent control data is less worthwhile. If you have frequent small transfers (a temperature maybe), it makes sense to minimise the overhead in transmission -but maybe just batching the transfers is as good.",171,0,0,0
1213,1209,0,NA,3,"Are you asking about the protocol or the message format? We often incorrectly use the term protocol when we mean the format of the data. I do this myself, often because the distinction isn't clear to everyone.Messaging protocols used in IoT tend to be fairly compact, at least more so than http and offer significant features that are important in messaging (sessions, flow control, reliability, etc). The message format is the of data in the message that get sent. I assume that this is what you are asking about.The most compact message format is a carefully considered hand-rolled binary format. It is frequently used when in low-bandwidth scenarios when you want to send a few bytes, and know exactly what those bytes look like. For larger messages the disadvantages are significant and, in general, should be avoided at all costs.I went through a detailed assessment on many different data serialisation options. I expected protobuf, messagepack to be fairly compact, which they were. However, my second problem was finding libraries that were maintained and available on a number of different platforms, including C on the device.The format that I settled on, surprisingly, was gzip compressed JSON. It is easy to implement and understand, runs everywhere, and, with the data that I was using, was about the same, or smaller, than other methods.Also beware that if you have a secure channel such as TLS, you're going to consume a chunk of data (>6KB) in TLS handshakes anyway.A few years ago, I expected a format like protocol buffers to dominate, but not much really happened. Probably because of the ease at which json can be written out and parsed (and compressed). I like the look of Flatbuffers, but the advantage is more on parsing speed than being compact.Since you are at the investigation stage, I suggest you write a bit of code on each, using data that is typical to you situation, and do some comparisons. Having hard data when you start helps confirm your choices.",332,0,0,0
